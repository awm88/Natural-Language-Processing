Security messaging is a good way to communicate specially for people specially retired people who live overseas and difficult for them to call but it seems people of secure messaging don't have enough information to help and just waste of time. I suggest you correct this.<br/>2. It is much better you send a notification when customer logs in if there is a problem before you block loging in and other measures.<br/>3.TD is old fashion and only use phone and not text. I suggest TD uses Whatsapp that is secure and can call too. TD personel not using email even a short email for alert.<br/>4. It is much better to send an email to customer whenever logged in like other banks. This will improve security.\n",

            "                When I said \"another odd experience\" in a previous post, this is why.  A while back I ordered checks.  Simple enough, right?  Never received them, and after a ton of calls and emails finally got to the bottom of it... they were returned because I have a PO Box, no mailbox at my physical address.  When I inquired why - we don't send checks to a PO Box...for security reasons.  LOL<br/><br/>OK, let me get this straight.  You'll stick a box of checks in a roadside mailbox that any thief/crackhead/etc can cruise by and take at 3am.  But you won't send them to my PO Box at the local Post Office, which is behind lock and key, has multiple cameras recording, and they'd need a half stick of dynamite to blow it open and get my checks. All righty then.<br/><br/>Also, I have a house that I sold and get monthly payments via money order.  If I deposit them, they are treated like checks... they are \"pending\" as though it was a check that needed to clear.  No, money orders are like cash.  So, every month I go to the Drive Thru and say - I'd like to cash this money order.  No problem.  I don't even touch the envelope with the cash in it, I just drop a deposit slip on top and say - OK, now I'd like to deposit that.<br/><br/>It's stupid, and makes them do two transactions instead of just one, but if that's what they force me to do in order for a cash deposit to be immediately available... well, that's their problem.\n",

            "                I would like to complain about the financial advisors at TD Bank on Lawrence and Midland. I had an appointment with Oluwayomi Akanji on 5th Jan to open an RESP. I was kept waiting for an hour and then when the meeting started, she could not get her computer system running. I waited for another hour and finally I had to leave with no work done. <br/><br/>My second appointment was with Vaishagi Ravendran on 26th April for the same reason. I specifically told her I need to open a self directed RESP and I will manage my own investments. Despite my instructions she opened a term RESP and did not advise me properly. The work was still not done after 1 hour and she kept saying she has another meeting. She rescheduled my meeting with another financial advisor after one week. <br/><br/>My third appointment was with Madhavi Khandelwai today and I was told to bring my wife and kids to sign the papers by Vaishagi because my RESP has to be 'joint' (again based on wrong advice). I came on time and after 1.5 hours of meeting I still could not get my Direct Investing RESP set up because she could not get in touch with the DI Investing contact person and was getting some system error. Madhavi told me to come back on Monday and meet Vaishagi (because she will be on holiday) and get my RESP set up with her. <br/><br/>So to summarize it took me a very long time and I still have not been able to set up a simple direct investing RESP because the financial advisors have poor knowledge and the technical support provided is inadequate. Also there are very few financial advisors and the number of people who need financial advisors seems high so these financial advisors don't have time for appointments. <br/><br/>It was a highly frustrating experience and I look forward to better experiences in the future.\n",

Never received them, and after a ton of calls and emails finally got to the bottom of it... they were returned because I have a PO Box, no mailbox at my physical address.  When I inquired why - we don't send checks to a PO Box...for security reasons.  LOL<br/><br/>OK, let me get this straight.  You'll stick a box of checks in a roadside mailbox that any thief/crackhead/etc can cruise by and take at 3am.  But you won't send them to my PO Box at the local Post Office, which is behind lock and key, has multiple cameras recording, and they'd need a half stick of dynamite to blow it open and get my checks. All righty then.<br/><br/>Also, I have a house that I sold and get monthly payments via money order.  If I deposit them, they are treated like checks... they are \"pending\" as though it was a check that needed to clear.  No, money orders are like cash.  So, every month I go to the Drive Thru and say - I'd like to cash this money order.  No problem.  I don't even touch the envelope with the cash in it, I just drop a deposit slip on top and say - OK, now I'd like to deposit that.<br/><br/>It's stupid, and makes them do two transactions instead of just one, but if that's what they force me to do in order for a cash deposit to be immediately available... well, that's their problem.\n",

            "                I would like to complain about the financial advisors at TD Bank on Lawrence and Midland. I had an appointment with Oluwayomi Akanji on 5th Jan to open an RESP. I was kept waiting for an hour and then when the meeting started, she could not get her computer system running. I waited for another hour and finally I had to leave with no work done. <br/><br/>My second appointment was with Vaishagi Ravendran on 26th April for the same reason. I specifically told her I need to open a self directed RESP and I will manage my own investments. Despite my instructions she opened a term RESP and did not advise me properly. The work was still not done after 1 hour and she kept saying she has another meeting. She rescheduled my meeting with another financial advisor after one week. <br/><br/>My third appointment was with Madhavi Khandelwai today and I was told to bring my wife and kids to sign the papers by Vaishagi because my RESP has to be 'joint' (again based on wrong advice). I came on time and after 1.5 hours of meeting I still could not get my Direct Investing RESP set up because she could not get in touch with the DI Investing contact person and was getting some system error. Madhavi told me to come back on Monday and meet Vaishagi (because she will be on holiday) and get my RESP set up with her. <br/><br/>So to summarize it took me a very long time and I still have not been able to set up a simple direct investing RESP because the financial advisors have poor knowledge and the technical support provided is inadequate. Also there are very few financial advisors and the number of people who need financial advisors seems high so these financial advisors don't have time for appointments. <br/><br/>It was a highly frustrating experience and I look forward to better experiences in the future.\n",

Security messaging is a good way to communicate specially for people specially retired people who live overseas and difficult for them to call but it seems people of secure messaging don't have enough information to help and just waste of time. I suggest you correct this.<br/>2. It is much better you send a notification when customer logs in if there is a problem before you block loging in and other measures.<br/>3.TD is old fashion and only use phone and not text. I suggest TD uses Whatsapp that is secure and can call too. TD personel not using email even a short email for alert.<br/>4. It is much better to send an email to customer whenever logged in like other banks. This will improve security.\n",

            "                When I said \"another odd experience\" in a previous post, this is why.  A while back I ordered checks.  Simple enough, right?  Never received them, and after a ton of calls and emails finally got to the bottom of it... they were returned because I have a PO Box, no mailbox at my physical address.  When I inquired why - we don't send checks to a PO Box...for security reasons.  LOL<br/><br/>OK, let me get this straight.  You'll stick a box of checks in a roadside mailbox that any thief/crackhead/etc can cruise by and take at 3am.  But you won't send them to my PO Box at the local Post Office, which is behind lock and key, has multiple cameras recording, and they'd need a half stick of dynamite to blow it open and get my checks. All righty then.<br/><br/>Also, I have a house that I sold and get monthly payments via money order.  If I deposit them, they are treated like checks... they are \"pending\" as though it was a check that needed to clear.  No, money orders are like cash.  So, every month I go to the Drive Thru and say - I'd like to cash this money order.  No problem.  I don't even touch the envelope with the cash in it, I just drop a deposit slip on top and say - OK, now I'd like to deposit that.<br/><br/>It's stupid, and makes them do two transactions instead of just one, but if that's what they force me to do in order for a cash deposit to be immediately available... well, that's their problem.\n",

            "                I would like to complain about the financial advisors at TD Bank on Lawrence and Midland. I had an appointment with Oluwayomi Akanji on 5th Jan to open an RESP. I was kept waiting for an hour and then when the meeting started, she could not get her computer system running. I waited for another hour and finally I had to leave with no work done. <br/><br/>My second appointment was with Vaishagi Ravendran on 26th April for the same reason. I specifically told her I need to open a self directed RESP and I will manage my own investments. Despite my instructions she opened a term RESP and did not advise me properly. The work was still not done after 1 hour and she kept saying she has another meeting. She rescheduled my meeting with another financial advisor after one week. <br/><br/>My third appointment was with Madhavi Khandelwai today and I was told to bring my wife and kids to sign the papers by Vaishagi because my RESP has to be 'joint' (again based on wrong advice). I came on time and after 1.5 hours of meeting I still could not get my Direct Investing RESP set up because she could not get in touch with the DI Investing contact person and was getting some system error. Madhavi told me to come back on Monday and meet Vaishagi (because she will be on holiday) and get my RESP set up with her. <br/><br/>So to summarize it took me a very long time and I still have not been able to set up a simple direct investing RESP because the financial advisors have poor knowledge and the technical support provided is inadequate. Also there are very few financial advisors and the number of people who need financial advisors seems high so these financial advisors don't have time for appointments. <br/><br/>It was a highly frustrating experience and I look forward to better experiences in the future.\n",

Security messaging is a good way to communicate specially for people specially retired people who live overseas and difficult for them to call but it seems people of secure messaging don't have enough information to help and just waste of time. I suggest you correct this.<br/>2. It is much better you send a notification when customer logs in if there is a problem before you block loging in and other measures.<br/>3.TD is old fashion and only use phone and not text. I suggest TD uses Whatsapp that is secure and can call too. TD personel not using email even a short email for alert.<br/>4. It is much better to send an email to customer whenever logged in like other banks. This will improve security.\n",

Never received them, and after a ton of calls and emails finally got to the bottom of it... they were returned because I have a PO Box, no mailbox at my physical address.  When I inquired why - we don't send checks to a PO Box...for security reasons.  LOL<br/><br/>OK, let me get this straight.  You'll stick a box of checks in a roadside mailbox that any thief/crackhead/etc can cruise by and take at 3am.  But you won't send them to my PO Box at the local Post Office, which is behind lock and key, has multiple cameras recording, and they'd need a half stick of dynamite to blow it open and get my checks. All righty then.<br/><br/>Also, I have a house that I sold and get monthly payments via money order.  If I deposit them, they are treated like checks... they are \"pending\" as though it was a check that needed to clear.  No, money orders are like cash.  So, every month I go to the Drive Thru and say - I'd like to cash this money order.  No problem.  I don't even touch the envelope with the cash in it, I just drop a deposit slip on top and say - OK, now I'd like to deposit that.<br/><br/>It's stupid, and makes them do two transactions instead of just one, but if that's what they force me to do in order for a cash deposit to be immediately available... well, that's their problem.\n",

            "                I would like to complain about the financial advisors at TD Bank on Lawrence and Midland. I had an appointment with Oluwayomi Akanji on 5th Jan to open an RESP. I was kept waiting for an hour and then when the meeting started, she could not get her computer system running. I waited for another hour and finally I had to leave with no work done. <br/><br/>My second appointment was with Vaishagi Ravendran on 26th April for the same reason. I specifically told her I need to open a self directed RESP and I will manage my own investments. Despite my instructions she opened a term RESP and did not advise me properly. The work was still not done after 1 hour and she kept saying she has another meeting. She rescheduled my meeting with another financial advisor after one week. <br/><br/>My third appointment was with Madhavi Khandelwai today and I was told to bring my wife and kids to sign the papers by Vaishagi because my RESP has to be 'joint' (again based on wrong advice). I came on time and after 1.5 hours of meeting I still could not get my Direct Investing RESP set up because she could not get in touch with the DI Investing contact person and was getting some system error. Madhavi told me to come back on Monday and meet Vaishagi (because she will be on holiday) and get my RESP set up with her. <br/><br/>So to summarize it took me a very long time and I still have not been able to set up a simple direct investing RESP because the financial advisors have poor knowledge and the technical support provided is inadequate. Also there are very few financial advisors and the number of people who need financial advisors seems high so these financial advisors don't have time for appointments. <br/><br/>It was a highly frustrating experience and I look forward to better experiences in the future.\n",

Security messaging is a good way to communicate specially for people specially retired people who live overseas and difficult for them to call but it seems people of secure messaging don't have enough information to help and just waste of time. I suggest you correct this.<br/>2. It is much better you send a notification when customer logs in if there is a problem before you block loging in and other measures.<br/>3.TD is old fashion and only use phone and not text. I suggest TD uses Whatsapp that is secure and can call too. TD personel not using email even a short email for alert.<br/>4. It is much better to send an email to customer whenever logged in like other banks. This will improve security.\n",

Never received them, and after a ton of calls and emails finally got to the bottom of it... they were returned because I have a PO Box, no mailbox at my physical address.  When I inquired why - we don't send checks to a PO Box...for security reasons.  LOL<br/><br/>OK, let me get this straight.  You'll stick a box of checks in a roadside mailbox that any thief/crackhead/etc can cruise by and take at 3am.  But you won't send them to my PO Box at the local Post Office, which is behind lock and key, has multiple cameras recording, and they'd need a half stick of dynamite to blow it open and get my checks. All righty then.<br/><br/>Also, I have a house that I sold and get monthly payments via money order.  If I deposit them, they are treated like checks... they are \"pending\" as though it was a check that needed to clear.  No, money orders are like cash.  So, every month I go to the Drive Thru and say - I'd like to cash this money order.  No problem.  I don't even touch the envelope with the cash in it, I just drop a deposit slip on top and say - OK, now I'd like to deposit that.<br/><br/>It's stupid, and makes them do two transactions instead of just one, but if that's what they force me to do in order for a cash deposit to be immediately available... well, that's their problem.\n",

            "                I would like to complain about the financial advisors at TD Bank on Lawrence and Midland. I had an appointment with Oluwayomi Akanji on 5th Jan to open an RESP. I was kept waiting for an hour and then when the meeting started, she could not get her computer system running. I waited for another hour and finally I had to leave with no work done. <br/><br/>My second appointment was with Vaishagi Ravendran on 26th April for the same reason. I specifically told her I need to open a self directed RESP and I will manage my own investments. Despite my instructions she opened a term RESP and did not advise me properly. The work was still not done after 1 hour and she kept saying she has another meeting. She rescheduled my meeting with another financial advisor after one week. <br/><br/>My third appointment was with Madhavi Khandelwai today and I was told to bring my wife and kids to sign the papers by Vaishagi because my RESP has to be 'joint' (again based on wrong advice). I came on time and after 1.5 hours of meeting I still could not get my Direct Investing RESP set up because she could not get in touch with the DI Investing contact person and was getting some system error. Madhavi told me to come back on Monday and meet Vaishagi (because she will be on holiday) and get my RESP set up with her. <br/><br/>So to summarize it took me a very long time and I still have not been able to set up a simple direct investing RESP because the financial advisors have poor knowledge and the technical support provided is inadequate. Also there are very few financial advisors and the number of people who need financial advisors seems high so these financial advisors don't have time for appointments. <br/><br/>It was a highly frustrating experience and I look forward to better experiences in the future.\n",

Security messaging is a good way to communicate specially for people specially retired people who live overseas and difficult for them to call but it seems people of secure messaging don't have enough information to help and just waste of time. I suggest you correct this.<br/>2. It is much better you send a notification when customer logs in if there is a problem before you block loging in and other measures.<br/>3.TD is old fashion and only use phone and not text. I suggest TD uses Whatsapp that is secure and can call too. TD personel not using email even a short email for alert.<br/>4. It is much better to send an email to customer whenever logged in like other banks. This will improve security.\n",

            "                When I said \"another odd experience\" in a previous post, this is why.  A while back I ordered checks.  Simple enough, right?  Never received them, and after a ton of calls and emails finally got to the bottom of it... they were returned because I have a PO Box, no mailbox at my physical address.  When I inquired why - we don't send checks to a PO Box...for security reasons.  LOL<br/><br/>OK, let me get this straight.  You'll stick a box of checks in a roadside mailbox that any thief/crackhead/etc can cruise by and take at 3am.  But you won't send them to my PO Box at the local Post Office, which is behind lock and key, has multiple cameras recording, and they'd need a half stick of dynamite to blow it open and get my checks. All righty then.<br/><br/>Also, I have a house that I sold and get monthly payments via money order.  If I deposit them, they are treated like checks... they are \"pending\" as though it was a check that needed to clear.  No, money orders are like cash.  So, every month I go to the Drive Thru and say - I'd like to cash this money order.  No problem.  I don't even touch the envelope with the cash in it, I just drop a deposit slip on top and say - OK, now I'd like to deposit that.<br/><br/>It's stupid, and makes them do two transactions instead of just one, but if that's what they force me to do in order for a cash deposit to be immediately available... well, that's their problem.\n",

            "                I would like to complain about the financial advisors at TD Bank on Lawrence and Midland. I had an appointment with Oluwayomi Akanji on 5th Jan to open an RESP. I was kept waiting for an hour and then when the meeting started, she could not get her computer system running. I waited for another hour and finally I had to leave with no work done. <br/><br/>My second appointment was with Vaishagi Ravendran on 26th April for the same reason. I specifically told her I need to open a self directed RESP and I will manage my own investments. Despite my instructions she opened a term RESP and did not advise me properly. The work was still not done after 1 hour and she kept saying she has another meeting. She rescheduled my meeting with another financial advisor after one week. <br/><br/>My third appointment was with Madhavi Khandelwai today and I was told to bring my wife and kids to sign the papers by Vaishagi because my RESP has to be 'joint' (again based on wrong advice). I came on time and after 1.5 hours of meeting I still could not get my Direct Investing RESP set up because she could not get in touch with the DI Investing contact person and was getting some system error. Madhavi told me to come back on Monday and meet Vaishagi (because she will be on holiday) and get my RESP set up with her. <br/><br/>So to summarize it took me a very long time and I still have not been able to set up a simple direct investing RESP because the financial advisors have poor knowledge and the technical support provided is inadequate. Also there are very few financial advisors and the number of people who need financial advisors seems high so these financial advisors don't have time for appointments. <br/><br/>It was a highly frustrating experience and I look forward to better experiences in the future.\n",

Security messaging is a good way to communicate specially for people specially retired people who live overseas and difficult for them to call but it seems people of secure messaging don't have enough information to help and just waste of time. I suggest you correct this.<br/>2. It is much better you send a notification when customer logs in if there is a problem before you block loging in and other measures.<br/>3.TD is old fashion and only use phone and not text. I suggest TD uses Whatsapp that is secure and can call too. TD personel not using email even a short email for alert.<br/>4. It is much better to send an email to customer whenever logged in like other banks. This will improve security.\n",

Never received them, and after a ton of calls and emails finally got to the bottom of it... they were returned because I have a PO Box, no mailbox at my physical address.  When I inquired why - we don't send checks to a PO Box...for security reasons.  LOL<br/><br/>OK, let me get this straight.  You'll stick a box of checks in a roadside mailbox that any thief/crackhead/etc can cruise by and take at 3am.  But you won't send them to my PO Box at the local Post Office, which is behind lock and key, has multiple cameras recording, and they'd need a half stick of dynamite to blow it open and get my checks. All righty then.<br/><br/>Also, I have a house that I sold and get monthly payments via money order.  If I deposit them, they are treated like checks... they are \"pending\" as though it was a check that needed to clear.  No, money orders are like cash.  So, every month I go to the Drive Thru and say - I'd like to cash this money order.  No problem.  I don't even touch the envelope with the cash in it, I just drop a deposit slip on top and say - OK, now I'd like to deposit that.<br/><br/>It's stupid, and makes them do two transactions instead of just one, but if that's what they force me to do in order for a cash deposit to be immediately available... well, that's their problem.\n",

            "                I would like to complain about the financial advisors at TD Bank on Lawrence and Midland. I had an appointment with Oluwayomi Akanji on 5th Jan to open an RESP. I was kept waiting for an hour and then when the meeting started, she could not get her computer system running. I waited for another hour and finally I had to leave with no work done. <br/><br/>My second appointment was with Vaishagi Ravendran on 26th April for the same reason. I specifically told her I need to open a self directed RESP and I will manage my own investments. Despite my instructions she opened a term RESP and did not advise me properly. The work was still not done after 1 hour and she kept saying she has another meeting. She rescheduled my meeting with another financial advisor after one week. <br/><br/>My third appointment was with Madhavi Khandelwai today and I was told to bring my wife and kids to sign the papers by Vaishagi because my RESP has to be 'joint' (again based on wrong advice). I came on time and after 1.5 hours of meeting I still could not get my Direct Investing RESP set up because she could not get in touch with the DI Investing contact person and was getting some system error. Madhavi told me to come back on Monday and meet Vaishagi (because she will be on holiday) and get my RESP set up with her. <br/><br/>So to summarize it took me a very long time and I still have not been able to set up a simple direct investing RESP because the financial advisors have poor knowledge and the technical support provided is inadequate. Also there are very few financial advisors and the number of people who need financial advisors seems high so these financial advisors don't have time for appointments. <br/><br/>It was a highly frustrating experience and I look forward to better experiences in the future.\n",

Security messaging is a good way to communicate specially for people specially retired people who live overseas and difficult for them to call but it seems people of secure messaging don't have enough information to help and just waste of time. I suggest you correct this.<br/>2. It is much better you send a notification when customer logs in if there is a problem before you block loging in and other measures.<br/>3.TD is old fashion and only use phone and not text. I suggest TD uses Whatsapp that is secure and can call too. TD personel not using email even a short email for alert.<br/>4. It is much better to send an email to customer whenever logged in like other banks. This will improve security.\n",

Never received them, and after a ton of calls and emails finally got to the bottom of it... they were returned because I have a PO Box, no mailbox at my physical address.  When I inquired why - we don't send checks to a PO Box...for security reasons.  LOL<br/><br/>OK, let me get this straight.  You'll stick a box of checks in a roadside mailbox that any thief/crackhead/etc can cruise by and take at 3am.  But you won't send them to my PO Box at the local Post Office, which is behind lock and key, has multiple cameras recording, and they'd need a half stick of dynamite to blow it open and get my checks. All righty then.<br/><br/>Also, I have a house that I sold and get monthly payments via money order.  If I deposit them, they are treated like checks... they are \"pending\" as though it was a check that needed to clear.  No, money orders are like cash.  So, every month I go to the Drive Thru and say - I'd like to cash this money order.  No problem.  I don't even touch the envelope with the cash in it, I just drop a deposit slip on top and say - OK, now I'd like to deposit that.<br/><br/>It's stupid, and makes them do two transactions instead of just one, but if that's what they force me to do in order for a cash deposit to be immediately available... well, that's their problem.\n",

            "                I would like to complain about the financial advisors at TD Bank on Lawrence and Midland. I had an appointment with Oluwayomi Akanji on 5th Jan to open an RESP. I was kept waiting for an hour and then when the meeting started, she could not get her computer system running. I waited for another hour and finally I had to leave with no work done. <br/><br/>My second appointment was with Vaishagi Ravendran on 26th April for the same reason. I specifically told her I need to open a self directed RESP and I will manage my own investments. Despite my instructions she opened a term RESP and did not advise me properly. The work was still not done after 1 hour and she kept saying she has another meeting. She rescheduled my meeting with another financial advisor after one week. <br/><br/>My third appointment was with Madhavi Khandelwai today and I was told to bring my wife and kids to sign the papers by Vaishagi because my RESP has to be 'joint' (again based on wrong advice). I came on time and after 1.5 hours of meeting I still could not get my Direct Investing RESP set up because she could not get in touch with the DI Investing contact person and was getting some system error. Madhavi told me to come back on Monday and meet Vaishagi (because she will be on holiday) and get my RESP set up with her. <br/><br/>So to summarize it took me a very long time and I still have not been able to set up a simple direct investing RESP because the financial advisors have poor knowledge and the technical support provided is inadequate. Also there are very few financial advisors and the number of people who need financial advisors seems high so these financial advisors don't have time for appointments. <br/><br/>It was a highly frustrating experience and I look forward to better experiences in the future.\n",

Security messaging is a good way to communicate specially for people specially retired people who live overseas and difficult for them to call but it seems people of secure messaging don't have enough information to help and just waste of time. I suggest you correct this.<br/>2. It is much better you send a notification when customer logs in if there is a problem before you block loging in and other measures.<br/>3.TD is old fashion and only use phone and not text. I suggest TD uses Whatsapp that is secure and can call too. TD personel not using email even a short email for alert.<br/>4. It is much better to send an email to customer whenever logged in like other banks. This will improve security.\n",

When I inquired why - we don't send checks to a PO Box...for security reasons.  LOL<br/><br/>OK, let me get this straight.  You'll stick a box of checks in a roadside mailbox that any thief/crackhead/etc can cruise by and take at 3am.  But you won't send them to my PO Box at the local Post Office, which is behind lock and key, has multiple cameras recording, and they'd need a half stick of dynamite to blow it open and get my checks. All righty then.<br/><br/>Also, I have a house that I sold and get monthly payments via money order.  If I deposit them, they are treated like checks... they are \"pending\" as though it was a check that needed to clear.  No, money orders are like cash.  So, every month I go to the Drive Thru and say - I'd like to cash this money order.  No problem.  I don't even touch the envelope with the cash in it, I just drop a deposit slip on top and say - OK, now I'd like to deposit that.<br/><br/>It's stupid, and makes them do two transactions instead of just one, but if that's what they force me to do in order for a cash deposit to be immediately available... well, that's their problem.\n",

            "                I would like to complain about the financial advisors at TD Bank on Lawrence and Midland. I had an appointment with Oluwayomi Akanji on 5th Jan to open an RESP. I was kept waiting for an hour and then when the meeting started, she could not get her computer system running. I waited for another hour and finally I had to leave with no work done. <br/><br/>My second appointment was with Vaishagi Ravendran on 26th April for the same reason. I specifically told her I need to open a self directed RESP and I will manage my own investments. Despite my instructions she opened a term RESP and did not advise me properly. The work was still not done after 1 hour and she kept saying she has another meeting. She rescheduled my meeting with another financial advisor after one week. <br/><br/>My third appointment was with Madhavi Khandelwai today and I was told to bring my wife and kids to sign the papers by Vaishagi because my RESP has to be 'joint' (again based on wrong advice). I came on time and after 1.5 hours of meeting I still could not get my Direct Investing RESP set up because she could not get in touch with the DI Investing contact person and was getting some system error. Madhavi told me to come back on Monday and meet Vaishagi (because she will be on holiday) and get my RESP set up with her. <br/><br/>So to summarize it took me a very long time and I still have not been able to set up a simple direct investing RESP because the financial advisors have poor knowledge and the technical support provided is inadequate. Also there are very few financial advisors and the number of people who need financial advisors seems high so these financial advisors don't have time for appointments. <br/><br/>It was a highly frustrating experience and I look forward to better experiences in the future.\n",

Security messaging is a good way to communicate specially for people specially retired people who live overseas and difficult for them to call but it seems people of secure messaging don't have enough information to help and just waste of time. I suggest you correct this.<br/>2. It is much better you send a notification when customer logs in if there is a problem before you block loging in and other measures.<br/>3.TD is old fashion and only use phone and not text. I suggest TD uses Whatsapp that is secure and can call too. TD personel not using email even a short email for alert.<br/>4. It is much better to send an email to customer whenever logged in like other banks. This will improve security.\n",

            "                When I said \"another odd experience\" in a previous post, this is why.  A while back I ordered checks.  Simple enough, right?  Never received them, and after a ton of calls and emails finally got to the bottom of it... they were returned because I have a PO Box, no mailbox at my physical address.  When I inquired why - we don't send checks to a PO Box...for security reasons.  LOL<br/><br/>OK, let me get this straight.  You'll stick a box of checks in a roadside mailbox that any thief/crackhead/etc can cruise by and take at 3am.  But you won't send them to my PO Box at the local Post Office, which is behind lock and key, has multiple cameras recording, and they'd need a half stick of dynamite to blow it open and get my checks. All righty then.<br/><br/>Also, I have a house that I sold and get monthly payments via money order.  If I deposit them, they are treated like checks... they are \"pending\" as though it was a check that needed to clear.  No, money orders are like cash.  So, every month I go to the Drive Thru and say - I'd like to cash this money order.  No problem.  I don't even touch the envelope with the cash in it, I just drop a deposit slip on top and say - OK, now I'd like to deposit that.<br/><br/>It's stupid, and makes them do two transactions instead of just one, but if that's what they force me to do in order for a cash deposit to be immediately available... well, that's their problem.\n",

            "                I would like to complain about the financial advisors at TD Bank on Lawrence and Midland. I had an appointment with Oluwayomi Akanji on 5th Jan to open an RESP. I was kept waiting for an hour and then when the meeting started, she could not get her computer system running. I waited for another hour and finally I had to leave with no work done. <br/><br/>My second appointment was with Vaishagi Ravendran on 26th April for the same reason. I specifically told her I need to open a self directed RESP and I will manage my own investments. Despite my instructions she opened a term RESP and did not advise me properly. The work was still not done after 1 hour and she kept saying she has another meeting. She rescheduled my meeting with another financial advisor after one week. <br/><br/>My third appointment was with Madhavi Khandelwai today and I was told to bring my wife and kids to sign the papers by Vaishagi because my RESP has to be 'joint' (again based on wrong advice). I came on time and after 1.5 hours of meeting I still could not get my Direct Investing RESP set up because she could not get in touch with the DI Investing contact person and was getting some system error. Madhavi told me to come back on Monday and meet Vaishagi (because she will be on holiday) and get my RESP set up with her. <br/><br/>So to summarize it took me a very long time and I still have not been able to set up a simple direct investing RESP because the financial advisors have poor knowledge and the technical support provided is inadequate. Also there are very few financial advisors and the number of people who need financial advisors seems high so these financial advisors don't have time for appointments. <br/><br/>It was a highly frustrating experience and I look forward to better experiences in the future.\n",

Security messaging is a good way to communicate specially for people specially retired people who live overseas and difficult for them to call but it seems people of secure messaging don't have enough information to help and just waste of time. I suggest you correct this.<br/>2. It is much better you send a notification when customer logs in if there is a problem before you block loging in and other measures.<br/>3.TD is old fashion and only use phone and not text. I suggest TD uses Whatsapp that is secure and can call too. TD personel not using email even a short email for alert.<br/>4. It is much better to send an email to customer whenever logged in like other banks. This will improve security.\n",

Never received them, and after a ton of calls and emails finally got to the bottom of it... they were returned because I have a PO Box, no mailbox at my physical address.  When I inquired why - we don't send checks to a PO Box...for security reasons.  LOL<br/><br/>OK, let me get this straight.  You'll stick a box of checks in a roadside mailbox that any thief/crackhead/etc can cruise by and take at 3am.  But you won't send them to my PO Box at the local Post Office, which is behind lock and key, has multiple cameras recording, and they'd need a half stick of dynamite to blow it open and get my checks. All righty then.<br/><br/>Also, I have a house that I sold and get monthly payments via money order.  If I deposit them, they are treated like checks... they are \"pending\" as though it was a check that needed to clear.  No, money orders are like cash.  So, every month I go to the Drive Thru and say - I'd like to cash this money order.  No problem.  I don't even touch the envelope with the cash in it, I just drop a deposit slip on top and say - OK, now I'd like to deposit that.<br/><br/>It's stupid, and makes them do two transactions instead of just one, but if that's what they force me to do in order for a cash deposit to be immediately available... well, that's their problem.\n",

The person tells me she can't figure out why but there is not block and to just keep trying! Unreal! How many times do I have to try? I already tried 4 times while on the phone with them. The person just said it must be the company not them. I said well how is that possible when I have tried to make purchases from different companies and not one of them is letting my payment go through?

            "                I would like to complain about the financial advisors at TD Bank on Lawrence and Midland. I had an appointment with Oluwayomi Akanji on 5th Jan to open an RESP. I was kept waiting for an hour and then when the meeting started, she could not get her computer system running. I waited for another hour and finally I had to leave with no work done. <br/><br/>My second appointment was with Vaishagi Ravendran on 26th April for the same reason. I specifically told her I need to open a self directed RESP and I will manage my own investments. Despite my instructions she opened a term RESP and did not advise me properly. The work was still not done after 1 hour and she kept saying she has another meeting. She rescheduled my meeting with another financial advisor after one week. <br/><br/>My third appointment was with Madhavi Khandelwai today and I was told to bring my wife and kids to sign the papers by Vaishagi because my RESP has to be 'joint' (again based on wrong advice). I came on time and after 1.5 hours of meeting I still could not get my Direct Investing RESP set up because she could not get in touch with the DI Investing contact person and was getting some system error. Madhavi told me to come back on Monday and meet Vaishagi (because she will be on holiday) and get my RESP set up with her. <br/><br/>So to summarize it took me a very long time and I still have not been able to set up a simple direct investing RESP because the financial advisors have poor knowledge and the technical support provided is inadequate. Also there are very few financial advisors and the number of people who need financial advisors seems high so these financial advisors don't have time for appointments. <br/><br/>It was a highly frustrating experience and I look forward to better experiences in the future.\n",
