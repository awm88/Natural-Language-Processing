Skype	1	2020-10-09T22:27:47+00:00	I've had a skype account for over 10 years now.  A couple of weeks ago, they locked my account for suspicious activities when all I did was to top up my account £23.99. They then refused to return my money or unblock my account. A customer service supervisor said that she did an investigation and her decision was FINAL and NO ONE at Microsoft will be able to unblock my account. After I provided all information to prove that there was no fraudulent activities, she still refused to acknowledge that a mistake was made. Such arrogance is beyond belief.  Truly appalling!

Skype integrates desktop app to web app, so we are able to open Skype on the Web. It permits us to welcome up to 50 individuals to our assemble and appreciate free conferences on Skype. It allows us to share presentations, work materials in conference calls and helps to collaborate and monitor our work. It allows us to simply turn on the background blur feature for user's privacy concerns. It permits us to Record our call for later audits and note-taking purposes.

In 30days duration, the sent files on the messages are unable to download from the users. It needs a high-speed stable internet connection for the videoconference. It utilizes all the more processing assets of the devices that lead to the crashing of the application once in a while."

Skype	2	2020-09-25T09:28:42+00:00	"I subscribe to a landline number through skype.

It wasn't easy to give 2/5, because the price is very competitive and the service has been fine.

Except that I'm displeased with the recent service. Due to a really rubbish account-management website offered by skype, I was unable to switch my payment to a new card.

I received an email saying it couldn't take the £22.50 I was due to pay, even though I'd done my best to get my new card attached to the subscription. I then had to buy again, at the new higher price of over £40.

The online support person tried to instruct me how to do it right in future, but even his instructions first were completely wrong. The eventual way to do it was not at all clear, so it's unsuprising that I was unable to do it by myself. (I'm a regular computer user and good with websites/technology but still couldn't find it myself.)

However, in the end Microsoft still refused to let me have the original price - the one it had emailed me about and that I've paid all this time - saying it has reviewed its subscription prices.

I would have been fine if it had just wrote to me before the subscription renewal to say that it can't continue at the old prices. But it didn't. It tried to take payment at the original price and then, because it's website is a bit sucky, I ended up on the new price. I think I should be entitled to a refund and I'm surprised and disappointed that they didn't offer better customer service on this occasion.

Unfortunately I am stuck with them though. Although there are ways to port skype landline numbers, their price for the landline number is simply too competitive - even at the higher price of £40ish per year."

That's a shame for traditional Skype because I have had years of good service from it and mostly free apart from when I used it to call landlines and mobiles.  I would give old Skype four stars.

Skype Meet Now is another matter. I have wasted the best part of an afternoon because I tried to set up a group meeting on Meet Now rather than Zoom.

The hype suggests Microsoft is as good as if not better than Zoom. Not in my experience. Two people struggled. OK, they are not tech savvy, but they managed fine with Zoom.

One had an issue because she had an old version of Skype that was triggered by the Meet Now link.

The other uses Safari browser. This appears to be incompatible with Meet Now.

And apparently there is no option to stop this from happening because Skype really likes to interrupt whatever software you are using, not only that, and it will also turn down the volume of every single program running on the computer by 50%, and there is no option to disable that as well. I thought it was a voice chat program, not a toxic-attention-seeking-relationship partner.
I an wondering, during the Corona virus quarantine, where online chats and video conference software skyrocket their client counts, how does Skype manage to fail so disgustingly. Did you guys get paid to purposely make the software terrible? So that everyone will switch to using Zoom or other of your competitors? Because it is so difficult to make a product with such terrible quality even doing so intentionally.

""We evaluated your appeal and verified your account was properly closed for a serious violation of the Microsoft Services Agreement. 
Pursuant to our terms, we cannot reactivate your account, nor provide details as to why it was closed. This represents Microsoft’s final communication regarding this account."" They pointed that account some ""terms"", so-called ""code of conduct"" was ""seriously violated"", but there was no real explanation - what exactly were the reasons for that. 

I haven't found ANY exact info about what can you possibly broke in terms of your ""code of conduct""...

No exact numbers in terms of daily / weekly / monthly connections, no info about restrictions etc.
Don't get me wrong - we can easily dismiss Skype from our messengers for the clients and ask them to use Telegram, Wattsapp or good old ICQ for further connections. 
In addition - I'm strongly disagreed with their disposition on following:
""We have seen abusive behavior that includes one or more of the following:

﻿Sending excessive new contact requestsReporting excessive abuse reports on other accountsSearching an excessive amount of contacts in Skype
Abusive behaviour they saying, comparing me with a spammer? Sending excessive new contact requests - what is ""excessive""? Where is a measure or volume of it, declared in your ""Code of conduct""? 
Reporting excessive abuse reports on other accounts - had reported only several contacts for heavy spam. Again - where is the number, conducting that ""excessive"" amount?
Searching an excessive amount of contacts in Skype  - same as above. If you have an exact number of those searches (which in my opinion - utterly weird to even apply for) - kindly show it to me, so I'll be aware of it.
Summarizing all above: me personally and my firm, my colleagues and our clients using Skype as a way of communication, not for spam (to make it clear once and for all). We use it to contact, because our clients use it, nothing more, nothing less. 
So by restricting access for me or any support manager like myself - you are simply creating a bad experience for other Skype users and slowly losing a competition against other services like yours."
Skype	5	2020-07-09T12:45:00+00:00	Great communicating service. Probably the best and Microsoft only keeps improving it.
Skype	4	2020-07-03T07:05:09+00:00	I'm using skype every day because it's being used as communication channel in my company. It's fine, but since it's so popular I think it could be a bit faster. I think it could be faster when searching, since this is something I use often.
Skype	2	2020-07-02T03:23:16+00:00	I dont know why but I couldn't use this app very often on my pc because I go to much blue screen, i really hate it.
Skype	3	2020-06-30T13:54:26+00:00	"No the bad app to connect with family and friends, but needs to be updated for sure, not really that comfortable anymore like it was before
Still useful"
Skype	1	2020-06-30T11:06:12+00:00	I used to use skype everyday.Since their redising i cant seem to figure how to add people on the new account. Are they using a UX designer? my god they should use a better one, or listen to the advice of an expert.
Skype	1	2020-06-26T22:13:39+00:00	I use Skype for international phone calls, their rate are pretty cheap and connection generally good. Got new phone, installed app, and realized I didn't remember password. A nightmarish loop of trying to recover it. Too long to explain it here but I can't believe how bad Microsoft has made it. Tried to get help through a chat and Twitter support for days. Incompetent idiotis.
Skype	5	2020-06-24T19:51:33+00:00	use it every day to talk to family in Estonia
Skype	1	2020-06-19T10:22:08+00:00	Terrible app, no service. Blocked a landline for no reason, no way to contact support. Raised the rate for USA landlines from two to twelve cents per minute. Added connection charges. Awful UI. Dropping calls....After many years using Skype as my primary telephony service I’m leaving. I wish I didn’t have to. But I really have no choice.
Skype	4	2020-06-18T18:35:12+00:00	For interoffice communication it is great but for group video its not as easy to use or navigate. Depends on what you are trying to do but there are other good options out there for video.
Skype	2	2020-06-17T10:57:00+00:00	"I had an Skype account since 2003 and was great to use. However now Microsoft links the account to the same email of a computer. But this feature is not available on old accounts. So my credit and agenda is lost. They request me to buy new credit.
Worst think is that Microsoft customer service is fooling me sending my request on a dead end questionnaire loop. What a pity that Skype was bought by Microsoft and their   incompetent customer service.
So unfortunately after having a great service the only option is to use other comm app."
Skype	1	2020-06-14T16:21:01+00:00	"Horible search engine
saves files for only 30 days
Bad performance 
Actually unbelievable that this is one of the most popular communication platforms in 202 with the features it has."
Skype	1	2020-06-08T21:38:35+00:00	"My Skype experience has been awful.  I had used the app for a video conference days ago and then didn't open it again. However, I was informed by a fellow user that I was seen on Skype '7 hours ago.'  This was untrue!  Then, I signed out and back in. This same person said after I did that, my status changed to 'last seen days ago.'  
I have tried to reach Skype for help and that is impossible.  My account has been closed and I will not be returning to Skype.
I do not typically write reviews but I don't like being seen on-line when I am not on-line and no one at Skype/Microsoft is available to help me.
Goodbye, Skype."
Skype	1	2020-06-07T14:17:18+00:00	Can't reach my friend on Skype today. It's not doing the ringing tone at my end, just the double beep thing, it's ringing at his end but a message appears saying unable to connect please try again later. When you DO connect the speech is garbled and the video quality varies from crystal clear to a smudge on virtually every call I make. It was light years better before Microsoft got hold of it, in fact Microsoft Messenger was good too. Been trying now for 30 minutes and no chance of a connection:-(
Skype	1	2020-06-03T18:46:29+00:00	"Skype Sucks

They really missed their chance. Im glad there are other platforms for video conferencing now since skype bugged and i've lost the ability to access my account."
Skype	3	2020-06-02T19:58:54+00:00	They improved it a bit so i am gonna rate it 3 stars now
Skype	1	2020-06-02T16:07:46+00:00	Skype is just garbage compared to all other videochat services
Skype	5	2020-05-29T21:28:02+00:00	All good.Best features set in the communication world. Great sync between moble and desktop. The best emoticons ever. Best call quality. WhatsApp sucks with video call quality.
Skype	1	2020-05-28T16:20:26+00:00	"Of all the chat/call apps available, Skype is the worst.

It used to be great, but then Microsoft bought Skype and decided to ruin it.

Now you aren't allowed multiple chat windows, chat messages can take hours to arrive. Notifications that you have new messages can just not happen. People think they are calling you, but your PC never rings. Managing the options through the settings is a nightmare.

Use anything else if you have the option. The only thing it is good for is calling ""real"" phones. The international calling rates are pretty cheap."
Skype	1	2020-05-28T10:41:21+00:00	This is the worst app ever, that doesn't let me call anyone or pick up someone's call. I have to reinstall it to attend a call😠😠🤬🤬👎👎👎.
Skype	1	2020-05-27T09:21:23+00:00	"Any device with skype on is a fire risk, PLEASE UNINSTALL!!!!!. I've had a blackberry neon explode and now a ""Thinkpad X240, running Ubuntu 20.04 give me a overheat warning"" the company behind this application, it seems is trying to kill us all, PLEASE GET RID, YOU'LL  DIE. learn from mine and my brother's experience I implore you please. Personal Statement ""The company' behind this service is unhappy they're bust and obviously p*ssed we the consumer are responsible because we don't want their terrible software.

It's your own fault, Microsoft, Windows 8 and onward sucked the joy out of computing. Not ours.""

Once upon a time I hated Apple. ""Their facetime is flawless, I'm now an Apple convert""

""Microsoft is like Futurama's MOM corp... EVIL""
""Apple may be expensive... but worth it."""
Skype	2	2020-05-26T21:05:20+00:00	I rarely use Skype to be honest. There’s so many easier alternatives. But when do use it I find it needlessly complex and unergonomic. Perfect example: all I wanted to do today was see through a friends webcam whilst simultaneously texting through the inbuilt text option. After twenty minutes of fiddling I couldn’t work out if it was even possible. I had managed to take a screenshot somehow but that’s it.
Skype	3	2020-05-21T03:05:05+00:00	Is it possible that Skype has been 50% down ever since Microsoft took over ? Ain't no Skype-Hater here but please guys, improve the product and establish some kind of customer service!!!
Skype	1	2020-05-13T12:09:33+00:00	No Support, No good since microsoft to over the product.
Skype	4	2020-05-13T07:48:45+00:00	One of the best app in this field.
Skype	1	2020-05-08T05:51:20+00:00	When you need to contact the Better Business Bureau (BBB) to cancel your subscription, you know things are bad. Multiple phone calls, phone lines that are completely out of service, being taken in circles around the website, broken links - Skype has it all. Microsoft have turned into absolutely incompetent scammers - pathetic.
Skype	1	2020-05-07T16:32:39+00:00	WHY IS IT SO HARD TO CHANGE A MOBILE NUMBER... DELETING MY ACCOUNT AND ADDING MY NEW ONE ON THAT NEW PROFILE IS EASIER... WHEN THAT HAPPENS THAT MEANS ITS TOO COMPLICATED.
Skype	1	2020-05-06T18:32:45+00:00	"It's become a steaming pile of poop ever since Microsoft acquired Skype. It used to just work. Now my messages take ages to load. Today I just got locked out of my account for no apparent reason, just some vague ""security"" excuse and I could only unlock it by giving them my phone number. 

Terrible product. Would NOT spend a single cent on it."
Skype	1	2020-05-03T18:25:37+00:00	"I used to work on this product, left in 2013. Since I left, Microsoft has absolutely destroyed this wonderful communications tool by aggressively moving it from a simple application to an ""APP"" based, cloud driven pile of garbage that tries to hook into too many other Microsoft products and accounts, then just when Microsoft reach peak unusability, they stop developing the platform. Teams is just as bad, you'll have to use an application with poor security, or they routes its communications through China to get a decent video call experience this lockdown.
Literally 3/4 of the calls with family on Skype consist of troubleshooting it not working."
Skype	1	2020-04-30T03:07:23+00:00	The latest update of Skype has wowed much in the audience, but honestly it’s just an app. You cannot possibly expect us to prefer it over top picks like WhatsApp when you kick users for no reason, I hope you take this to heart and personally I really hope you improve Skype. I’ve been kicked out two times for no reason and I’ve informed all my children who told their friends that Skype just doesn’t work. It’s a no-go for my entire neighbourhood because they all experience the same flaw. Fix it or Microsoft will be a piece of junk in a few years. All it takes is one hater. I was happily chatting when the app removed me from my account, twice, once I sign in the same thing happens again and again. I urge you to change the way it functions. You are not protecting your customers by shoving them away. I assure you there’s nothing wrong with us, it’s Microsoft that sucks. Please improve it. I hope we’ve no personal feelings as I’ve seen many experience this problem. Skype logs me out and says there’s something wrong with my account, so I go to account recovery and Guess what they tell me? They say they haven’t enough info to recover. I gave them my email, contacts, personal information such as birth date and they haven’t the heart to accept a simple request. If this is protecting your customers, then don’t protect your customers anymore.
Skype	1	2020-04-29T16:35:26+00:00	Locks you out of your account for no reason to extort additional personal information from you. Either you had over more personal information or you don't get your account back
Skype	1	2020-04-28T21:45:17+00:00	"Skype number - paid subscription.
Please avoid it at any cost.  It doesn't work.
People cannot connect or when they call me can't hear me. It's nothing to do with my microphone because it works when I do test calls. I tested 3 devices same story again and again. And it works when I call someone back. 
I cancelled my subscription. 
There is no way to get in touch with anyone to discuss technical issues or get refunds.  
Big disappointment. I would call it a petty theft.  Skype charges connection fees too on top of normal rates.  
Premium rates for non working service.
It so bad Microsoft purchased it. It is like with their other products.  They just get worse and worse every day."
Skype	1	2020-04-27T07:37:14+00:00	Very very bad. In has never been good and still manages to get worse!
Skype	1	2020-04-26T10:59:50+00:00	Dreadful, I have been a skpye customer for years, but it has got worse, from never being very good, the site is unavigable, and the visual and sound connection and standard is woeful.
Skype	1	2020-04-23T11:44:40+00:00	My Skype account was hacked. (I since learned there is a way to do that and I dont want to give too much information as to how that was done. It was very obvious as to what they did when I looked at my account.) Through the auto recharge set up with my PayPal and then with my bank account the hackers managed to take hundreds of euro from me. They ran through my Skype credit and straight into the auto recharge which is linked with my PayPal account. Multiple repeat takings emptied my PayPal balance inside a minute. Then in a domino effect they used the same method with the auto recharge function to get into my bank account. By the time more than 400 euro was taken my banks fraud detection shut it down. In the end the hackers cleaned me out of more than 600 euro. My Bank paid me back as did PayPal. The scam and hack is/was very obvious. Could not be calls as autorecharge went through consequetively within seconds running into hundreds of euro. Skype did not and have not been co operative at all with this. Disgusted with Skype and strongly recommend everyone to not have auto recharge set up with Skype. You are open to the same hacking and scam I was and your bank may not be as supportive as mine was. Skype certainly wont be.
Skype	1	2020-04-22T13:38:08+00:00	"Skype decided to keep our credit balance of £5.61, without consulting us. 
It's not the amount, it is the principle of unprofessional and deceptive practices.
Our credit balance appeared on the 20 April and then it was gone the very next day on the 21 April, 2020."
Skype	1	2020-04-22T12:57:24+00:00	Awful!!! Tons of bags, terrible speed,history of message loses. The reason I use it because lots of people made the same mistake
Skype	4	2020-04-21T11:59:36+00:00	Works fine for me. I use it mostly to call international numbers. Turned out to be much cheaper than mobile networks. The only issue I faced was a bug in the android app causing a loud beep sound when disconnecting the call. The issue was fixed after I replaced the regular skype app with the Skype Lite.
Skype	1	2020-04-20T10:07:32+00:00	"My school setup a group on skype.
First call: Everyone joins, I join and i only hear robotic voices. I know this issue from discord so i do the fix i would do on discord. Skype crashes.
Second call: I can't even join
Third call: Works but all the cameras are 144p and the audio has weird demonic screams (your computer screaming for help because it has to handle this software)
Now we use Discord.
Please don't use skype for more than 1 people, most of the time, it doesn't even let me join so...
Worst thing from microsoft, even worse than windows 8."
Skype	1	2020-04-16T12:56:59+00:00	Don’t even try app is hopeless - totally frustrating- does not work - don’t waste your time - go to zoom instead
Skype	5	2020-04-12T13:45:14+00:00	Use skype since 2014 for gaming, pretty good quality and optimised so doesnt slow pc down.
Skype	1	2020-04-10T11:47:57+00:00	"it is unreliable. I make a call, don't hear anything but see seconds ticking, so call is on. I push the button on my headphone, what happens then?
or it cuts the call
or still can't hear anything
or I hear the other side and he hears me
Why 3 times or, why is it always different.
I haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaate this"
Skype	5	2020-04-10T09:06:10+00:00	Been using Skype like forever. Especially since I am forced to do Home Office now Skype is just amazing. Connecting with all my colleagues for daily conference calls. All works pretty good. Quality is top notch, at least most of the times I am using it.
Skype	1	2020-04-09T14:16:43+00:00	"I would give this product zero stars if I could.  We are desperately trying to connect with our family during lockdown and this product has become IMPOSSIBLE to use.  I had used skype for years before with no trouble whatsoever.  Now it is so frustratingly bad, and the support is non-existent.

1) I am unable to access my old skype username and identity, it is impossible to delete it and it is still searchable.
2) It took over an hour to make contact between my brother and I on skype as it was impossible to find each other on the 'search contacts'.  I say this as two tech-savvy people who were on the phone to each other the whole time, trying to link up.  Totally impossible for any of my elderly family to fathom by themselves.
3) The 'MeetMe' as a Guest simply did not work for my aunt - it repeatedly asked her to create a profile.
4) Trying to set up a profile is impossible for an elderly person to manage - Multi-factor authentication and the captcha puzzle - despite two hours patient coaching we could not manage to help my aunt through this - her eyesight is not very good.
5) We set up a profile ourselves for our aunt, but now cannot log in to it as it says we are breaching some sort of protocol.  I could just scream with frustration, WHY IS IT SO HARD!

I would swap products but then we've only just managed to get some of the other family on, and now we can no longer visit them to help.

Sort it out Microsoft, this is appallingly bad."
Skype	4	2020-04-09T14:14:08+00:00	Works great didn't experience any problems and there desktop app works very good :-)
Skype	2	2020-04-07T22:17:46+00:00	This is NOT a very good VOIP service.  I usually have to restart my computer 2 or 3 and sometimes even 4 times before I can get both sound and video.  I don't have these problems with Zoom.  It just plain works.
Skype	1	2020-04-04T06:54:10+00:00	"Just an update in October to say no contact or support has every been received in spite of contacting them again. Frankly they can’t be trusted and have now emailed (automated) to say the credit on the account has expired for non use! Nightmare company.

—————

(This was first filed 3 weeks ago there has been zero co-operation from Skype / Microsoft. If you rely on a Skype in number for personal or business use don’t because if it goes down you will get zero help and be left on your own)

I hate leaving poor ratings but I see now why Microsoft (who own Skype) already is rated bad. My experience is truly horrendous. They asked us to validate the account and sent multiple messages then locked us out (validator app on the office computer seemed to malfunction so we requested email confirmation) and we received the automated message below. Not only did they cut off the account they disconnected all the Skype in numbers (there was no issue with Skype) which meant my mother in her 90s and other elderly family members can't reach us and are distraught. My mother is in a care home very frightened about the virus and kept crying to the staff saying ""my son is ill"" this is not the case but she is used to phoning the Skype in number as we are in different countries. We have used Skype since the first year it started and never had an issue this has been catastrophic causing great distress to several people in theirr 80s and 90s and the message below shows support is non existent and as far as ""All duplicate requests will be closed and responses will be sent on the original escalation."" Does this show they just don't care? In spite of having calling plans and everything we are dumping Skype as the Skype in numbers expire, cancelling the subscriptions and moving to Vonage which has always been faultless. There is enough stress with the Corvovirus without these incompetents adding to it.

TODAY IS MAY 17TH THE NIGHTMARE STARTED ON APRIL 3RD STILL NOTHING HEARD FROM SKYPE/MICROSOFT SO I HAVE PORTED THE SKYPE IN NUMBERS TO OTHER PROVIDERS AND PAYPAL HAVE CHARGED BACK 3 NUMBERS I WILL PURSUE THE OTHER LOSSES IN THE SMALL CLAIMS COURT - NIGHTMARE EXPERIENCE!"
Skype	1	2020-04-03T12:03:53+00:00	I have used Skype for years to connect with family and friends regularly.  We are all located in various countries. In spite of some occasional technical problems, I was always happy to have the ability to not just connect but see the faces of my loved ones!  One of my friends is elderly, lives in Germany, and does not own a computer or smart phone - only a home phone.  I started a subscription 10 years ago allowing me to call her for 60 minutes per month.  This subscription was to be automatically renewed year over year.  For ten years this worked beautifully.  In March 2020, during our Corona virus self quarantine, I checked in with my friend in Germany a number of times.  The calls frequently dropped and I called her back. I did not pay attention that I had used up my 60 minutes for the month.  When I attempted to call my house bound friend on April 1, my international subscription was cancelled.  After finally reaching a live person at Microsoft Customer Service, I was advised of alternative Skype subscription which is 8 times more expensive.  I explained the reason why I had overused my 60 minutes during March, but my account still showed I had a subscription.  I was advised that the old subscription would not be available to me until March 2021, if then!  This is the company policy!  During this time of COVID 19, where all companies who are able, are doing whatever they can to help people who are under terrible stress, one of the largest and most lucrative companies in the world has cancelled my $13.50 annual subscription.  Microsoft, you should be ashamed!  Mr. Gates would be ashamed to know that in spite of all the good he is doing in the world, this is what has happened in his old company!
Skype	1	2020-04-03T09:27:34Z	"My mind just cannot fathom how is it possible that a company with unlimited funds has such a disastrous product in its portfolio. I remember loving skype back before it was bought by Microsoft. It was simple and most importantly, it worked. I am forced to use skype because the whole company uses it and let me tell you, it's painful.

It's really slow. Sometimes it closes by itself another time it will not turn on. 
New messages sometimes don't show up for no apparent reason. 
Copy function on images doesn't work.  I always have to print screen it or save it to use it elsewhere. 
Copy function on messages sometimes copies the message two times -> you copy Hello, paste it and its HelloHello
and so many other bugs

The icing on the cake is that there is another version besides the desktop one. The one from Microsoft store and boy oh boy, I don't even know how is it possible but that one is even worse."
Skype	5	2020-04-03T02:54:22Z	Great App, Very handy for communications
Skype	1	2020-04-02T19:40:24Z	not worth a one star rating - it is unbelieveable how bad skype actually is - interface impossible to work out and with a frind on a phone and us both with skype open on our computers we compleately failed to work out how to contact each other!!!
Skype	1	2020-04-02T12:10:44Z	"Skype is a disaster since it was purchased by Microsoft. It is the year 2020, if people do not have the option to have separate skype accounts for: work, friends & job interviews or hobbies then they do not have the option either to participate in modern life. Microsoft has a responsibility here that goes beyond the corporate one. 

At my workplace we disregarded Skype as an option because it is not the safest way to communicate with clients. 
Politically speaking it is a mess that Microsoft is unwilling to treat users in a decent manner. The security questions are illegally forcing millions of users to provide Microsoft with information which they have no right to know (phone number, billing information, credit card information even if you didn't sign up with it etc.). And they are leaving European and American users no other choice than to use foreign services which will spy on them (as well) but use that to another country's advantage. 
Personally, (I am located in Germany) I haven't had access to any of my Skype accounts on any of my devices since 2015. I didn't sign up again for it either and I am using different services for work as well as privately. I am not going to give Microsoft my phone number and I will not use the service again. Even Whatsapp has the option for video calls and I consider it to be quite awkward when some businesses give a pass to Skype but use a ""freetime"" app like Whatsapp instead. That is downright embarrassing for a company. Microsoft had Skype since 2011 which means that they have failed to improve Skype for nine years. The corona outbreak will give Skype some superficially increased numbers but after that I expect the service to die since competitors don't wait nine years to hear, let alone impress users."
Skype	5	2020-04-01T18:11:17Z	I am using skype for 11 years now and i dont have problems, i talk with my family for hours without any issues, thank you
Skype	1	2020-03-27T19:54:25Z	As part of the current covid crisis, I purchased Office 365 to help me with my home working and in the hope I could use Skype to make presentations to my co-workers on line. How mistaken I was. I even tried to download the Skype for Business from my college website as it's part of the internal package. Complete waste of time and effort. Very disappointed, Microsoft.
Skype	1	2020-03-27T16:27:20Z	fu**ck skype, it took my 10 minutes to repair password that i fuc**king know blyat
Skype	1	2020-03-27T16:25:23Z	Terrible. I place a call but it doesn't ring on the other side. Or the call connects but one person is missing audio. If the person receiving the call ends the call, my whole Skype app freezes. Sometimes I see duplicate Skype apps running in the background. Basically, use Zoom instead.
Skype	1	2020-03-26T13:21:21Z	"CPU usage is unbelievable, version 8 glitching on audio only and video calls and presentation sharing working 50% of the time
And at the end of EVERY call, you are invited to review it. EVERY call !
All that is gained with this feature is a ""one over five star"" rating every time I use it. Plain dumb"
Skype	5	2020-03-25T14:53:55Z	Great service for video calls. I'm using it often for chatting  and when I need to make my private video calls. The quality of video calls sure depends on internet speed, however audio calls have good quality even with low speed connection.
Skype	1	2020-03-24T16:10:16Z	Ever since Microsoft bought Skype I can't access my Skype account. They blocked my account, which is linked to an old email address that I have no access to anymore. There is no way I can change the linked email address without logging in to skype, absurdly. They have asked me to go to a URL with my Microsoft account, which I tried, but it didn't redirect even though I specially created a Microsoft account. To log in to that Microsoft account, they forced me to give them my phone number. So now on top of my money they also stole my data. Tried logging into Skype again after reinsatlling, same thing - turning in circles and no access to my Skype account with the money on it. Tried to contact their customer support, spent 4 hours waiting in the chat and then gave up after being the next in line for more than an hour. It's hopeless - forget Microsoft. I am trying to call through Viber or other apps now. Thanks for stealing my money, Skype... DO NOT USE SKYPE ANYMORE! Microsoft will make sure you regret it.
Skype	5	2020-03-24T04:10:55Z	Frankly speaking, I didn’t like Skype and preferred not to use it at all because of the poor quality of connection, constant freezes and other problems. But I am really glad that they managed to change. The connection quality has been improved significantly. Now I use Skype much more often. It is good progress I might say.
Skype	1	2020-03-21T15:11:36Z	"If I write all the bad things of Skype 8, then I am afraid the available space will not enough. So I will just write this. Very slow!!! I use i5 and 16GB RAM but still slow.

If I could give zero stars I will give zero stars, or even minus 5 stars

I miss Skype version 7."
Skype	1	2020-03-19T09:45:30Z	If I could give it less stars I would. audio has never worked consistently on desktop version. Just made a call on the mobile and I have the option of seeing me with my contact in a little circle or half and half. I know what I look like, I want to see the other person
Skype	3	2020-03-19T09:07:49Z	The newest version of Skype uninstalled itself and thank you very much for not-doing Skype when I had to go to very important videoconference. I had to install it once again. Some of programmers should think twice about their careers.
Skype	1	2020-03-16T08:59:56Z	Videocall quality invariably glitchy, impossible to find clear instructions on how usernames work (do you send contacts the live: part or not?), perennial sign-in issues that send you on infinite security loops, every option you want (if it even exists) hidden in secret menus.
Skype	1	2020-03-04T05:38:04Z	"I subscribed to Skype for international calling and after 2 month using just wanted to canceled
 Although I cancelled my subscription yesterday they charged me for nothing. Poor service, poor customer experience. Very bad never use it again. Never."
Skype	1	2020-03-02T22:41:31Z	I couldn't even place a call even though I have a subscription. I had to cancel 3days into the  30days free trial. they then had the nerve to tell me I can continue using till the 30days is up--yeah right! you can't even connect me to my subscription even when I have paid subscription. Customer/technical service will never get back to you on your problems.  If I never had outlook mail as an alternate mail, I wouldn't want to mess with any microsoft products...well except the ones force on my throat by my employer because the majority of companies are using windows products.l
Skype	5	2020-02-29T20:56:57Z	I am not sure why people posting many bad things about that people but I can really tell you that I am more than happy to use all of this products and Microsoft only improved it and changed to it instead of their Microsoft Messenger (do you remember it?)
Skype	1	2020-02-26T23:54:39Z	Skype was once an advanced piece of communication software. Most Microsoft modifications have resulted in negative impact on this program. The logic of the user interface is complicated and difficult to handle. Simple features available in most other programs, such as copy and paste are hidden in some sub menues and difficult to detect. I always have the impression that a computer freak w/o any real life knowledge has been told to change the program without adding a useful feature. This program will one day die as many other MS products.
Skype	1	2020-02-17T09:10:00Z	just awful. Microsoft killed it dead
Skype	1	2020-02-15T18:37:49Z	I had a Skype account 3 years ago and it was great. I tried accessing it recently but had forgotten my password. When I tried to reset password, I was asked all kinds of questions by Microsoft including my credit card info if I had purchased their products in the past. I am not about to provide that info just so that I can reset my password. FaceTime is much much better and easier to use. So long Skype.
Skype	2	2020-02-14T09:13:18Z	"Skype used to be good - really good. 

Then Microsoft got involved and it went downhill.

there is a lesson to be learned here - don't try to fix something that isn't broken. 
Far too many bugs & issues now."
Skype	1	2020-02-12T19:28:45Z	"Lacks important features other VoIP-programs feature for a long time.
Unstable.

UI not clear enough."
Skype	1	2020-02-08T06:46:51Z	17% CPU time. I'm using i7 8700.
Skype	1	2020-02-07T04:58:55Z	It's just terrible
Skype	1	2020-02-05T18:07:20Z	"Impossible to contact anyone at Skype.The virtual agent is brain dead.
I eventually managed to speak with someone but they were from Microsoft and advised that Skype had limited personnel and put me back to where I was with the virtual agent .
Scary to think that Skype that used to be good has descended into chaos under Microsoft.
I only put one star as it was impossible to give less.
Useless enterprise -"
Skype	1	2020-02-04T11:09:19Z	"I just cannot believe it is a product of Microsoft. 
The basic searching function is really horrible. It is just not working."
Skype	1	2020-02-03T19:24:11Z	"For most countries, voip phone calls using services like ""Line"", ""Whatsapp"", ""Facetime"", etc work well, and they are free voice calls 
- quality may not be great but no problem. 
Exception is calls to United Arab Emirates. For that, to call from UK, i either pay the mobile charge of £3 per month to call using international-reduced-fees, which is £0.14pm for UAE, or I used to use skype-to-go. But recently Skype-to-go simply connects and call is silent and if you don't hang up it ""eats up"" all your credit. Or, in calls at few seconds into the call, all you hear is same recorded conversation of initial few seconds, a loop of repeating, replaying what you, or the other person said - in my experience, this bug used up 10min of credit even after i hung up. 
*BE very careful with skype with credit* as it can become much more expensive than using your normal line to call. One may say, it was a bug, not Skype's fault, Skype still paying the PSTN calls, but when the service is unsuitable and doesn't deliver the required quality to hold a consumer conversation, they should not be allowed to charge for it. It is a badly designed Skype service, so as part of consumer rights, I shouldn't be charged for a service that doesn't work. Yet Skype has been getting away with this and no refund is provided."
Skype	1	2020-02-01T19:00:15Z	"Charged $200 to my skype account, told me it was fraudulent and refused to refund the money:
""We understand that you are asking if Skype will refund the charges. I do apologize about it. However, we are unable to process refund for the fraudulent charges on the account.
 As previously suggested, we strongly advise you to contact your bank, to receive the money back from the unauthorized transactions, as well as to stop any unauthorized transaction being made in the future on either skype.com or any other website.
 Should you have further concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Skype	1	2020-01-28T22:22:43Z	I have been with Skype for many years and appreciate the product.  BUT they make it impossible to make negative changes.  There's no talking with anyone.  Not possible.  I have been trying for 3 months to cancel a subscription, but can't even when following their directions!!  I would like to choke all of them I so damn frustrated!!
Skype	3	2020-01-27T10:27:29Z	Skype Lite on Android is the only redeeming quality that Skype has.... and even then sometimes there are missed notifications.
Skype	1	2020-01-19T09:32:21Z	something always broken and general user interface is clumsy.
Skype	1	2020-01-12T22:18:13Z	Terrible poor functionality, cannot copy text, cannot searching messages. The searching is completely broken, it does not work at all.
Skype	2	2020-01-11T23:32:43Z	No reason to use anymore and with updates just getting worse and worse, Skype will die
Skype	2	2020-01-07T18:32:42Z	I've been one of the first users of Skype since its beginning. I was enthusiastic about it until it was bought by Microsoft and changed dramatically. Features that I loved simply disappeared and I wouldn't characterize it as user-friendly with these unnecessary and inexplicable changes.  I'm not the only one complaining; it's thousands of good old users who are disappointed. Some examples: Very bad synchronization with other devices. On Windows 10 having two windows when minimizing it!?! This is so frustrating! No alphabetical order of contacts option on the desktop version, like it used to be. Colorless and boring; too much black and white. I'm wondering if the developers really check if anything they change makes any sense or makes our life easier. When something is excellent, it doesn't need to change just for the sake of making it upbeat or whatever. I still use it on a daily basis for my work, but I'm not the enthusiast I used to be.
Skype	1	2020-01-06T15:12:06Z	Horrible, audio is messed up (volume mixer does not work) DOES NOT ALWAYS CALL EVEN IF THE OTHER PERSON IS ONLINE, crashes, WORST SOFTWARE IN MY PC
Skype	1	2019-12-30T03:44:00Z	It started as a great innovative app years back and was extremely convenient and simple to use. Ever since Microsoft bought it, they just gradually destroy it, they remove useful features. Useful is the wrong word, they remove necessary features and it becomes bulkier, uglier and useless with every new update they implement. There were so many people who used to use this app for business and daily communications, but it's become unusable. R.I.P Skype
Skype	1	2019-12-26T18:40:48Z	"Skype is the most execrable piece of software that I ever have to use.  It's been like this for years and seems never to improve.  Tonight I called someone and the video was completely mashed - looking like the type of pattern one used to see on signal failures in analogue TVs about 30 years ago.  And there's no way of telling the high and mighty software owners!  This was after I upgraded to the ;atest version of the software on my last use of it, a few days ago. (That's nother thing, Skype has had more version releases than there are stellar bodies in the universe.  Why?).
I really should move to somthing that works, but the trouble is thta so many people use it that one has little in the way of creating a driving force to move to something better.
The other thing that I have disliked for years (going back to times long before Microsoft bought it) is that the whole user interface of the software is designed to suck you into it and make as much as possible out of me, the customer, as possible.  Asking for your contact lists etc. is for the birds, so transparently Sh**ty.
Skype needs a huge clean-up and attitude change if it to get any form of positive score from me."
Skype	1	2019-12-25T19:11:22Z	Skype used to be fantastic. A great way to make calls easily and was worth paying for. Now it is a joke. For an entire year, with repeated attempts, I have not had a single call actually work out. The reception is abysmal at all times. Thankfully there are alternatives that are so much better than this rubbish
Skype	1	2019-12-22T08:10:49Z	Worst shet ever
Skype	1	2019-12-21T22:06:42Z	Utter rubbish. I logged in correctly with correct user name and correct password, but account has my old email address but this cannot be changed as MS insists on me having access to it. How stupid is that
Skype	1	2019-12-14T23:28:54Z	Skype became a rip-off with no transparent terms specially for paid subscriptions. Would not recommend it.
Skype	1	2019-12-11T22:10:07Z	Everything that was great about Skype is gone for a while now. This new Skype 8.5x looks like a kids toy, works slowish and sluggish, does its thing on its own without allowing users to disable/enable some basic things such as spelling checker. Also, it randomly started signing me out without the option to remember my password and sign me back in. Happens few times in a day.
Skype	1	2019-12-11T15:23:30Z	Skype is broken, new version since 2018 or so sucks!
Skype	1	2019-12-11T09:00:00Z	I have never been a fan of Skype even at the best of times. Recently, I had an online tutor for my Hungarian lessons and he suggested that we video chat on Skype and I thought that that was fair enough. I went to log in and found out that I was banned/locked out for no reason! Despite trying absolutely everything, I could not get them to overturn the ban. I tried to create a new account but that turned out to be a palaver so we video chatted over a different app in the end. An absolute waste of time and space.
Skype	1	2019-12-02T15:12:29Z	"For years, I've paid for a Skype number AND the monthly ""extra"". If I didn't actually need it all, I'd most certainly send Skype a quite detailed, curt little notice with detailed instructions on where to put their service, their staff and their entire corporation, and rest assured, none of it would be considered ""civil"" in ANY social circles. Horrific! Horrible! Pathetic! Disgusting! Some-times all goes well and incoming calls ring perfectly on any device. Most of the time, particularly since Microsoft took Skype, it doesn't work at all! No ring, no voice-mail, no service. They truly are merely a conglomeration of your basic thieves because they are fully aware of the service they don't provide and yet, there's no support and not a care in the world. (As I say: before Microsoft took over, Skype was quite a delight. Leave it to Microsoft. Now we all know how Mr. Gates got to be so wealthy.) If I could publish this in red font, with a putrid green glow about it, that might be more indicative of my long-term, experience-based review. I'm off to find the competition."
Skype	1	2019-12-02T13:00:19Z	"Terrible UI, deosn't work half the time under windwos 10 when ""minimized"" to notification area either."
Skype	1	2019-11-29T15:57:55Z	"Big peace of s***

Like the title says, this app is a bunch of errors"
Skype	1	2019-11-27T01:02:29Z	"It shows you the options of ""first month free trial"" after I give my credit card data it says ""you are not eligible for a free month trial, you were charged 7.67 euros"" 
This is scam, I did not ask for a refund because I need to call and didn't have the time for it, but this is basically stealing from you by providing false/ incomplete information in order to charge you."
Skype	1	2019-11-23T13:01:45Z	In an age where whatsapp and facebook messenger are available for free there is no use for skype, which is both costly and not very reliable. If you have credit on skype this is non-refundable so if you end up finding better solutions for wordwide communication skype will still keep your money forever or force you to use your credit on a platform you don't want or need to use. Ok customer service, not their fault the company they are working for has greedy and unfriendly policies. Stay away from skype, there are better solutions out there.
Skype	1	2019-11-20T09:29:09Z	people stopped to use skype so they decided to pre-install it inside windows. Genius.
Skype	1	2019-11-18T11:48:10Z	Skype is utter $hit
Skype	1	2019-11-17T21:06:13Z	New SKYPE was created for spying on users and their contacts. This is run and controlled now by NSA and HOMELAND with cooperation with other countries security services. They decides when Ypu can get connected with your contact and if You can send a video or not.
Skype	1	2019-11-17T09:56:05Z	"I have been trying to cancel my skype subscription for months following the online instructions sent in their e-mails to me, to no avail. You are not able to reply to the e-mail and there is no contact e-mail or number. After paying £14 every quarter for months I cancelled my subscription with my bank after trying to notify skype about this. I recently received several e-mails saying I needed to take urgent action and that my payment method had failed and then another e-mail several days later to say my subscription had been successful. As no money is coming out of my bank anymore, I am concerned that I am being charged money in accruing credit that I will have to pay at a later date. I am concerned this could affect my credit rating also. I have not used my account for years and have exhausted the different ways to try to contact them. I am actually considering approaching Citizens Advice about this.

Skype	1	2019-11-15T09:50:05Z	Trust microsoft to ruin a good platform, spent over 2 hours reinstalling it all and guess what, next day same thing. Absolutely useless, much better alternatives now. Use them.
Skype	1	2019-11-14T22:51:37Z	Going down hill, use other alternatives. Too unreliable for my likings.
Skype	1	2019-11-13T19:12:04Z	"Skype hide connection charges, on my Skype the call charge was clear at 2 pence per minuet however i was charged 10 pence per minuet!
Clear rip off and customer support just fed me BS!!!"
Skype	1	2019-11-11T09:27:38Z	is getting worse and worse I use it from 20 years and lately I get asked to sign in over and over again and each update is more a pain than the other
Skype	1	2019-11-10T14:57:06Z	new version is awful
Skype	1	2019-11-08T16:00:38Z	"My Skype does not work. It tells me to download an app and that its not synced with a Domain. You try to do this and it fails. My IT department says that we must download Skpye and set it up from scratch. However it won't let you delete the current installation and therefore you cannot ""start again"".. So I am caught in a never ending journey to nowhere. Webex and Teams work well without any of this trouble or nonsense. What an absolute joke."
Skype	1	2019-11-06T10:20:05Z	Use to be good, if you dont use it all  the time, when you need it, it is Password this and Password that and mixed up with my sons account.  Wait what, now I change his stuff again....akward for a person that pay and wants to talk to her mom???  If I contionue with my facebook account, it goes on my husband.  I just want to talk to my mother
Skype	5	2019-11-04T10:39:25Z	"In contact with Skype and service-staff John D Zamel, and must say; great service and know-how!

They helped me with a refund in regards of an order made, and I had the payment refunded to my Pay-Pal within minutes of the correspondence with Skype.

Great service, keep it up!"
Skype	5	2019-11-03T11:22:32Z	I like it! because I have been using it for quite a long time,evnen though there are so many social medias,like memesseng whatsapp.
Skype	1	2019-11-02T00:58:25Z	"Microsoft bought Skype, never a good thing as they usually ruin things. Skype is no exception. 

Cluttered, fussy UI in retina scorching colours. The blue was boring but I didn't want pretty I wanted to Message. 
Settings so hidden it takes forever to find them. 
Terrible call quality with frequent drops interference. 
No time zone indicator so I'm waking people up at 3am.
Suddenly bugging me for billing information, no thanks Microsoft, don't trust you with my card. 
Throwing FB ads at me when my fb and Skype aren't linked, creepy.....

After 12 years of happily using Skype, I'm off. Deleted off my phone and desktop."
Skype	2	2019-10-31T10:18:21Z	I have been using skype for a long time already and last update of skype is really bad. I believe Microsoft can fix this situation, but for now 2 stars it's max.
Skype	1	2019-10-31T08:29:49Z	Software is completely outdated and hackers can easily leak your information even if you don't accept them as your contact.
Skype	1	2019-10-27T11:00:17Z	Made my whole computer super laggy and was a pain in the a$$ to delete. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT!!!
Skype	1	2019-10-25T03:47:49Z	pleeese help. i know i am probable the millionth person asking this: But I am going nuts. when i open skype, using my microsoft account, it shows 6 contacts, only. When i go to settings/profile/ contacts, it shows all (approx 90) of my contacts.. How do i get them to appear on my skype page so that i can use the app.? otherwise, my money is sitting in there, wasted. When I go around the problem, by adding an old contact, i click on +contacts, enter their skype name and .....nothing happens. tia ++ UPDATE: Problem solved = re-registered my Microsoft account, logged on to Skype and voila! all my contacts reappeared after 6 furstrating months. I'll gonna move away from Skype, as there is no decent forum to ask questions on.
Skype	1	2019-10-16T18:07:58Z	Waist of time, how do I pull my credit out of this useless service?
Skype	1	2019-10-13T23:26:42Z	"Skype used to be good.

Now it's really bad! Almost unusable... this is unacceptable."
Skype	5	2019-10-11T22:53:49Z	One of the best platform for business.
Skype	1	2019-10-08T09:21:52Z	Not even Satan could conceive a worst punishment than Skype is to human kind. This could not be an accident. Some people have tried really hard to create the worst piece of software that the human kind will ever encounter. Missing basic functions like saving a conversation, searching through conversations is more painful than stepping on broken glass, missing common sense shortcuts and running slower than a slot on a high end machine. This is not Bad. The WW1 and WW2 were bad. This is a abomination!
Skype	1	2019-10-02T13:30:05Z	"Used to be great but going down hill. Latest upgrade is worse than ever. Used to give u a live update on call times does not do this basic function anymore, 
Full of bugs.  Trying to enter in a new contact is error prone and problematic. 
If there was comany in competition that can do landlines calls through the Internet I'd leave them in a shot."
Skype	1	2019-10-01T19:14:53Z	It used to be the best chat software, simple fast and reliable until Geniuses at Microsoft took over. Now it is absolutely unusable, buggy, impossible to login with the correct password, well .... just like everything else Microsoft creates.
Skype	1	2019-10-01T16:59:03Z	"Skype used to be good and fairly easy to use, now it’s horrible to use, every time you try to make a phone calls it’s logged you out of the app and  literally takes half an hour to log back in while you go though all sorts of crazy menus and prompts. Why doesn’t the iPhone app allow it to remember usernames and passwords.  It’s almost like they’ve made its as bad as they possibly can as a joke to see how far they can push people before everyone gives up with it. What a way to run a business 🤦‍♂️
It’s horrible, I hate it!"
Skype	3	2019-10-01T07:50:59Z	Not so bad but has a lot of bugs and updates are mostly annoying.
Skype	1	2019-09-30T11:51:55Z	Skype 8 - an example on how to burn your money. Soon no one will use it.
Skype	1	2019-09-27T19:48:54Z	this stupid program keeps reinstalling itself every 4 days, and I need to sign in over and over....stupid company
Skype	1	2019-09-23T11:49:57Z	Horrible Horrible Horrible... Boggles my mind how badly Microsoft ruined this program. Shame on you.
Skype	1	2019-09-20T12:37:19Z	Crap since Microsoft brought it. Tho Trustpilot and their constant censorship isn't much better
Skype	1	2019-09-19T23:47:25Z	"skype is Sh#@.
it was working before very well.
microsoft bought it and ruined it.

it has so many bugs that i do not even bother to count.
close it down. DiE.
let other companies who make useful programs continue.
kill skype. kill microsoft. this is the only solution for this garbage."
Skype	1	2019-09-16T18:10:56Z	"I friggin' HATE Skype (and Microsoft). For several years I'd used Skype. I live out of the US and I paid years for a virtual US phone number. Now recently I had severe computer problems and skype (and every other program) was uninstalled.
Yesterday I was able to reinstall skype on my computer. I logged in with my username and password. I'd previously had about $8.00 of credit, and I had just been charged for the next year's worth of my virtual phone number. Neither of these showed up on the new installation. No matter what I tried, I could not retrieve my credit or phone number. Skype kept insisting that I buy a new phone number.

I had skype on my phone, but had never used it. Today I tried that. Now it did not recognize my password, and twice I tried to change it. No way to see what characters and/or numbers I was entering, but I was never successful in creating a new password. I kept seeing ""passwords don't match."" I think that was a lie and they were just keeping me from logging in. And of course there's no way to actually contact Skype/Microsoft--just their worthless ""community."" I HATE SKYPE. THEY'VE RIPPED ME OFF FOR OVER $50."
Skype	1	2019-09-12T20:55:44Z	would give skype zero stars if i could. Its absolute rubbish now
Skype	1	2019-09-10T11:59:52Z	"Total crap, and they close your account in no longer than 5 days, without any explanation. And even though they have ""recover your account"" option, that's doesn't do anything. You enter what they require to recover your account word by word, and you get a message ""your account couldn't be recovered. There goes your money...skype stole it again"
Skype	3	2019-09-06T08:24:20Z	Not a problem but becoming archaic now -time for a refresh!
Skype	1	2019-09-05T20:06:03Z	"Skype just updated to latest version - totally dreadful- communication problems, cannot understand how to add new contacts as nonsense list provided from input. The most user unfriendly update ever. The previous version used just a couple of months ago worked perfectly.
Now unable to communicate with friends in Denmark."
Skype	1	2019-09-04T09:52:06Z	This is honestly the worst version of the platform. I need to use it for work and it is absolutely appalling. My friend who is in bootcamp for coding has made a more impressive application than this. I lost out on a job oppurtunity because it is impossible to find people.
Skype	1	2019-09-03T15:32:47Z	Skype is totally crap. Why you can't just listen your users, damn
Skype	1	2019-08-30T00:24:54Z	One of the worst customer service I encountered if I can put minus stars I wood there way below average
Skype	1	2019-08-29T16:53:17Z	"Skype is now so bad.  Microsoft should be ashamed - what a headless monster.

What replaces Skype? Bring it on."
Skype	1	2019-08-26T13:04:14Z	How could something that was SO good initially have become SO crap??!!
Skype	1	2019-08-22T15:37:54Z	You can't friggin delete your skype account without going through a ton of annoying stuff. Says it all.
Skype	1	2019-08-16T08:31:54Z	"So many important meetings and presentations ruined by this sloppy, negligent example of application design.

Plug-in install gets itself confused by the presence of SSO, so you have to use the web-guest mode - which then won't let you join audio via the computer if the install is detected. Neither can you view the screen of other presenters when in this mode.

Just terrible when compared with much more elegant solutions from Zoom, Webex, GTM etc."
Skype	1	2019-08-13T19:46:25Z	If I can give it 0 start I will.   We used to have Webex and every meeting will take place without issues.  Ever since our company switched to Skype due to cost, every meeting we have, we run into issues of audio not working intermittently, slide show getting stuck every time, recording not always working either, not to mention external participants unable to use it to do presentation to us.  All in all, it's a very bad product and I can't believe this is a product that's allowed in the market.   I know you get what you pay for but it should at least be something that works 99% of the time, not 1%.
Skype	4	2019-08-12T09:10:10Z	I am using Skype for my daily communication with colleagues and it never fails me. Sound and connection is always good. I dunno why there are so many negative feedback.
Skype	1	2019-07-28T19:55:42Z	this new layout is horrible, hard to navigate , old one was better it is super annoying to keep updating , it was good already  before , now it is not
Skype	4	2019-07-28T16:53:48Z	I got the best experience in using skype for video calls. I rely on this tool on calling my clients who are based in a foreign country.
Skype	1	2019-07-25T19:38:13Z	Horrible voice quality. Horrible Windows 10 user experience. Horrible mobile app. Hard to find friends with either phone number or e-mail. Would not recommend under any circumstances. I would give less than 1 star, but unfortunately, I am unable to do so.
Skype	1	2019-07-25T04:04:02Z	I would have preferred to give this no stars.  Compared with other technology I have studied, it has been a real headache. Although its not completely useless, it isn’t presented or explained clearly, and its almost impossible to get customer support. I would suggest to anyone that if they can find another way of communicating, not to bother with Skype.
Skype	1	2019-07-19T21:59:04Z	"There really hard to get in contact with. Ironically. 
Skype is the only way I can stay in touch with my husband while he’s in the states. But for some reason my subscription allows me to make calls but won’t allow any incoming calls it goes straight to busy. Supposebly it’s being escalated but I have no idea of how long. What’s going on. It’s so frustrating"
Skype	1	2019-07-18T18:37:31Z	I'd give it 0 stars if i could. No matter if it's on pc or a tablet or a phone, the Skype app isn't good. It's slow for everything. No-one seems to get notifications of messages or calls anymore. The gif section is pointless. The connecting and call quality isn't great. The whole app is a pain in the butt to use and pretty much everyone i know are migrating over to discord instead as it is just better than Skype at everything and they seem to actually listen to and care about their customers. Perhaps Skype has had its day? I certainly won't be reinstalling it the next time it breaks and i have to uninstall.
Skype	1	2019-07-11T13:29:45Z	If I could give Skype no stars I would! Terribly slow when typing messages and calls are not much better. I use it as little as I can but sometimes have to for business calls as work uses it. It was constantly updating and each up date it got worse. Not had an update for a while now thank goodness!
Skype	5	2019-07-09T03:25:06Z	Skype is a great tool that allows us to be communicated at any time, either from our house to talk with family or friends, or from the company to talk to customers, or to have video calls or video conferences, we can also talk on the phone sometimes free or at very low prices, I recommend it.
Skype	5	2019-07-05T17:10:05Z	I use Skype for all of my communication needs. They have a good interface and plenty of features!
Skype	1	2019-07-05T13:57:55Z	Navigation through the various functions is illogical. It's hit and miss whether it does what it should. The call quality is pretty good, but any positives are completely overshadowed by the appalling user experience. It needs a ground up redesign of the interface. It used to be great. Microsoft have completely ruined it.
Skype	1	2019-07-04T10:24:05Z	"It's still so bad that these days I dread using it. At one time I thought it was wonderful in the pre Microsoft days.
It doesn't seem to even alert me that I have missed a call. Absolutely awful now."
Skype	1	2019-07-03T02:16:10Z	"The lowest score of 59% (""bad"") is an unprecedented quality assessment ever conveyed by computer users. Degradation of this piece of software took the form of both UI and UX passing the critically unacceptable boundary of dissatisfaction. 
On a personal level, although I used to run Skype for Windows 10 years ago, subsequently switching to iChat (later Messages) and Facetime for Mac, now I found myself in the situation when I run Mavericks on 1 of my Macs, with that version of Mac OS X not having the Handoff mobile calls&SMS relay function. So, in order to avoid switching to a Mac with High Sierra every time I want to make a call from my other Mac, I desperately looked for a fitting substitute to run on Mavericks.  I downloaded Skype 8 and was stunned at how badly the software went downhill in terms of user interface and practicality: where you had clear, playful buttons, sliders, controls, chat rooms, separate windows, ribbons, a boatload of options for controlling the process of conversation to play with (and which made for a very nice native-looking Mac app despite it being cross-platform), now you have this dull, unified, monotonous, greyishly dabbed, emasculated, hard to navigate, unstable product. How MS developers could even think it would add up to an attractive, useful IM client that is the hardest enigma to contemplate.
I'm not the most original negative speaker on the topic however reviewing the contents of the main Skype app bundle, I did notice one thing: it's now built using the Electron framework whereas in the past they used to build it around the Hockey framework. Sorry to break it for you but every Electron app, essentially, is junk and crap: so is Grammarly, Slack - they're not ""apps"" in the sense you're accustomed to calling them so: it's just a web-page in a wrapper. The concept of Electron/React framework is very limiting and antagonistic towards the native desktop computing, so there you have it. Very bad."
Skype	1	2019-07-02T21:42:05Z	Cant even log on anymore. Somehow I have a Microsoft account logged to my phone and now I can even create a new account. Dreadful beyond believe. Absolutely ruined, well done Microsoft.
Skype	1	2019-07-01T18:19:35Z	My old skype finally stopped workiing yesterday and I was forced to use this new abomination. The connection is crap, the facility of splitting windows non-existent and the options sorely limited. Thanks microsoft for making a great program as useless as your old messenger!
Skype	1	2019-07-01T16:48:53Z	"After using the ""original Skype"" since inception, I can only say the Microsoft 8.  version is Hell disguised in a permanent nightmare !!
The fact that version 7 has been totally obliterated by Microsoft, makes me not even trust the companies PC systems (which they actually pioneered !!)  Skype is a total, total misery, all that was logically practical, the most user friendly setup has been lost. The fact that Skype just logs out, in the middle of being used is hair-pulling... what bunch of ignorants  did program version 8??  can't cancel just one conversation, either all or nothing, to pick up a incoming call it takes forever, I lose most of them and have to call back. The list is too long to tell, and it just gets me aggravated. ONE MESSAGE TO MICROSOFT: Bring Skype version 7 back or you will lose a longtime customer for good! (PC, Software and all!!)"
Skype	1	2019-06-27T13:00:42Z	Over the last few years Skype has been in a steady decline. User interface, IM options and reliability has all become worse and worse. I cannot recommend the current version of skype under any circumstances.
Skype	1	2019-06-26T16:43:04Z	Used to be great, but they killed their good native apps and introduced inferior webapps that are usuably slow.
Skype	1	2019-06-25T16:38:41Z	Just had a call from my manager as I work from home. I answered Skype on my PC and it crashed (this is common). But he immediately called again before I restarted it and I had to answer on my backup: my mobile. As he spoke his voice came out of the speaker rather than the earpiece so I had to quickly reset the speaker option. Call over, I called Skype from my landline to check it was still working and the ring was now coming just from the earpiece of my mobile and PC headset. Why is it so awkward to set up the ring? It's not as if every other phone on the planet doesn't work this way. Obvious problems like the in-call keypad # not working when typed on a keyboard, are not being fixed. My headset mute never synchronizes. When active, the Skype icon is now a big black square. The old PC software worked, and was vastly superior but Microsoft has now blocked its use. Did anyone at Microsoft ask what users wanted for the new version? Does anyone there care any more?
Skype	1	2019-06-25T10:35:42Z	Terrible products. In general I Love Microsoft products, Office is great, but skype is a mess, especially if you did use it before Microsoft bought it
Skype	3	2019-06-22T04:10:55Z	The quality of calls, video and voice, can't be denying. But i really hate the new interface.
Skype	1	2019-06-20T14:59:43Z	"It is beyond belief that anyone can create an interface that is so unintuitive in use.  No controls in Mobile app, just strange drag actions that are not explained. In the windows, a perfectly functioning Skype7 is crippled and an update is forced, while marketing advertises it as ""improvements"".

I wish I could give -1. I wish there were alternatives out there."
Skype	1	2019-06-13T23:06:13Z	I gave it this low rating because everytime I am on a video call and go to another app, the video would turn off even though I could still hear the other person i have to call them back so i could still see them.
Skype	1	2019-06-12T19:51:24Z	Just deleted Skype, hate it since Microsoft took it over, shame on them, total mess, but I don’t expect them to care really.
Skype	1	2019-06-12T18:29:36Z	"What a disaster skype has become since microsoft took it over. Trying to buy skype credit and having to change passwords twice each time (for who knows what reason) that I need more credit can take an hour. This time, I somehow lost all my contacts. 
The only reason I make skype calls now is to reach people in areas where whatsapp doesn't work. 
Microsoft has taken something that used to be simple and made it totally dysfunctional."
Skype	1	2019-06-10T15:27:22Z	New skype was made to be destroyed by some mean people. What a shame... I used to love skype and now I am unable to sign it because of loads and loads of verification codes and passwords that I am not even receiving. Just a major disappointment...
Skype	1	2019-06-09T07:49:30Z	"Just wasted 3 hours trying to delete old contacts that Skype syphoned off my phone... no joy.

Now they're on every platform Skype is installed and there is no way to remove them (seemingly), or it's so difficult/well hidden they're impossible to find!

I've never use a program that is less intuitive!

I even asked in their support section, and the response doesn't work either. Even Skype experts don't know how to delete any contacts!

A messaging program this difficult and unintuitive to use, that doesn't allow you to edit or delete contacts... one star is too high, deserves zero."
Skype	1	2019-06-05T17:55:08Z	"I wish I could give zero or negative stars. You took an app that I used all day every day, that I had a phone number for, that I had a subscription for, that I loved and told other I loved into a worthless, unusable, piece of $hit.

No touch tones were available so I had to use a touch tone generator to make calls?
Can't save called or received numbers to contacts?
Can't have multiple chat windows open simultaneously.
Unintuitive interface?
Been using this $hitty upgrade for so long and I still curse at it all day long and curse skype and the bean counters that green-lighted this abortion.
I don't know anyone who is even neutral about skype anymore, much less likes it. Everyone says it sucks.
You've done a magnificent job of screwing up a great app.
You're the Sears of messaging/calling apps"
Skype	1	2019-06-05T08:05:19Z	I really don't know what Skype is like now because I can never get into my account since it integrated with Microsoft, despite numerous attempts. So I've given up with it. I imagine I'm not alone in this.
Skype	1	2019-06-03T11:07:20Z	"No split view, to be able to run multiple chats in parallel
No decent alerts when a skype chat starts
Copy & pasting text breaks all microsoft standards, someone elses text can usually not be moused over to copy it, you need to hit those ridiculous 3 dots.
Images are downloaded automatically, usually not readable at  all

Skype 8 is a total disaster. It stinks, it sucks , it is the most miserable attempt to mimick whatsapp.
It leaves all desktop users, that need skype for PRODUCTIVE work, out in the woods.

Shame on you microsoft, for not listinening to your users.

And this would not have been bad, if you would have given your users the option to continue using Skype 7."
Skype	2	2019-05-28T20:54:49Z	Skype MADE me create a new account linked with my Microsoft account, and now there's no way to merge the two or do anything to prevent confusion between the two. Skype needs to find need a better solution to this issue that many people are having. I am angry at how unsophisticated their software is to deal with this. It's NOT okay.
Skype	1	2019-05-21T11:22:54Z	"Really disappointing!
I reinstalled the app on my mac several times. It simply does not work and causing so much trouble :-( Also I hear from many others that they are tired of the business version not working out properly. I am pretty surprised that the private free Skype version obviously works better than the business solution..."
Skype	1	2019-05-17T13:54:07Z	Skype is horrible.  It seems to have to do an update every other day of the week and when it does it changes the download folder for messages, and causes the auto login not to work.  This is ridiculous.  Can anyone recommend an IM program that is needed for only two things:  1) Instant Message 2) File Transfer.   I don't need video or any bells and whistles.  Just a basic program that is one download and done (don't have to mess with it daily).    Anyone?????????
Skype	1	2019-05-16T21:45:55Z	I lost all my contacts (from over the years) thanks to Microshite taking over Skype. Got railroaded into signing up with Microshite, who then removed the right to revert to a previous (more user friendly & functional) version of Skype. Why is it that when greedy corporate scumbags take control under the guise of 'progression' they inevitably feck things up! Wise old saying - if it isn't broken don't try and fix it!
Skype	1	2019-05-16T10:33:09Z	Once a beauty of a product with the most perfect user experience that took so many years to create, down to the smallest details and now its a pile of rubbish with bugs and warms all around. I'm fully convinced the entire developers team got canned and replaced with newbies with zero understanding of user experience! before the forced update I found a way to downgrade to the previous version and it felt like the biggest upgrade I've had in a very long time! now it's just a living nightmare of a product! nothing less than disgusting
Skype	1	2019-05-15T18:28:13Z	Can't connect or login, even though I know my login credentials. Got so bad after Microsoft acquired it. No support, and their help pages don't even load or are broken links! The few times that I did login years ago, it was so buggy. The worst part is, it acts like malware on my PC. I can't even uninstall it, but it keeps popping up from time to time.
Skype	1	2019-05-12T18:47:09Z	I don't get how the good program Skype was before 2008, could get to such a bad state. We had worse PCs and worse internet connections back then, but skype was neither heavy, nor did it cause ping issues. Sure it was buggy sometimes, but what the hell. Now it is just so slow, heavy and buggy and has some stupid ads + it is still buggy. Microsoft definitely killed a good program.
Skype	1	2019-05-06T10:53:06Z	"Makes Windows Vista look like a masterpiece.
Typical Microsoft ill-conceived, badly executed garbage. 
Trying quitting this steaming pile of @#$3, good luck! 
Assuming, of course, it hasn't crashed for no obvious reason or any reason it cares to tell you about.
User-interface that is perfect for torturing terrorism suspects"
Skype	1	2019-05-06T09:29:26Z	All the older versions worked perfectly but the new skype is horrible, before you could see the share screen and everyones cams at the same time and you could change their sizes but now this Ducking trash piece of chit microsoft only lets you see 1 window at a time, the connection is horrible even when my internet speed is over 100mbs The new skype is a complete piece of chit and should not have ever existed. Atleast if they were going to do a chit like this they shouldnt have blocked the old good versions. Its like microsoft wants everyone to kill themselves over the chit quality of skype.
Skype	1	2019-04-28T15:18:27Z	I've been using skype since 2008. It was a great program. But these new updates just suck. Lags, Interface, horrible to use.
Skype	1	2019-04-27T16:48:40Z	Logging into Skype has turned into a real debacle. The incompetent MS team has created the perfect trap for the elderly user. The trap is set by something as innocent (and very frequent for the elderly) as forgetting your own password. This is used by Skype as an opportunity to suggest to the user to create a MS account with which to log into Skype. After the unsuspected user agrees, the trap closes in. His entire history and friends list in his old account are rendered inaccessible. Moreover, even years later when the user tries to log into to the old account, his current account is rendered inaccessible. Skype gets into an infinite loops saying that the user account or password are incorrect. This happens even after the user changes the password of his current account through sms authentication. This entire thing us cursed. Avoid!
Skype	4	2019-04-26T08:45:15Z	I use Skype for talking with my friends. Very good application, but sometimes the connection is not good, but I think this happens because of my Internet speed.
Skype	1	2019-04-25T09:41:23Z	Horrible new version that they force upon u.
Skype	1	2019-04-24T16:01:09Z	"new skype 8 sucks horrid!

- no chatbox resize possibility

- totally overloaded chatbox surroundings too, with way too many stuff nobody really needs

- messages take years to load and go through, microsoft is a joke to release something like this to the public

- it just is slow slow, it lags lags, i never had such delays and lags with any prior skype version, everything was perfect until 7.42 version for 10 years and now look at this new skype 8 nothing worse ever made."
Skype	4	2019-04-23T17:31:52Z	I have been using Skype for chatting with colleagues, but it crashes from time to time and I need to restart it and wait for it to load. With calls I had no problems.
Skype	1	2019-04-22T15:56:38Z	Have not had a single uninterrupted skype call. The connection inevitably drops, the sound is terrible and the video constantly lags or freezes.
Skype	1	2019-04-19T08:59:26Z	Skippy is dead. RIP Skippy. When I try and sign in only my email of 10 years ago comes up. Poor Skippy. I have tried about 10 times now to reset password and email. New email works. Skippy barked. But the password does not. Skippy Farted. So this is called a circle of hell. There are no more humans at microsoft so I am not prepared to spend another hour on useless forums. Bye bye Skippy. You are dust
Skype	1	2019-04-18T08:36:55Z	Used to be more-less usable, not anymore! 'well done' Microsoft
Skype	3	2019-04-17T23:00:59Z	Skype has just gone downhill after being bought by Microsoft, the new UI is pretty terrible and constantly shifting arround the buttons is just annoying. Still, it gets the job done when you need to call someone.
Skype	5	2019-04-15T19:01:59Z	"Skype is the WORST product you hate to LOVE. 
If it weren't for the constant forced updates, the shifting of the buttons and everything else, it would be horrible. 
I receive at least 10 spam calls every single day! It's the best part about it really. 
Then one time, I tried to delete my skype phone number. That was great. I couldn't, and even more, I can't even keep people from calling me! Talk about customer satisfaction. 
Imagine. This is the most technical company on the planet (Microsoft) and we can't delete a number immediately. 
And people think we went to the moon!!  HAHAHAHA."
Skype	1	2019-04-15T12:29:40Z	"Why oh why every time I go to use Skype do I have to re-learn its interface because of yet another ""clever"" idea.  Used to be so simple to use, now Microsoft have their hands on it, its just infuriating to work with."
Skype	1	2019-04-13T14:17:21Z	Skype Classic was a perfect, simple to use tool. Now Microsoft is forcing an update that removed key features and has now become an electron app that is unacceptable. Microsoft also ignores everyone's request to bring back the original classic and now forces people to use their terrible new version. Shame what has happened to Skype.
Skype	1	2019-04-05T23:28:14Z	Used to be a light, functional and useful little assistant for work and family - MS has ignored its seasoned user base requests for a version of Classic to be available to those who want it and proceed to force features, privacy invasions and updates.  I will be putting in as much energy in encouraging my contacts to switch to any other app as i once put into promoting Skype until and unless MS provides a reasonable version.. if you want to know what that entails then look at V7 and previous.
Skype	1	2019-04-04T20:27:08Z	"It is truly sad to see what has happened to skype since Microsoft acquired it.  Years ago there were some connection quality issues caused by very variable data-connection-quality (not skype's fault). Now there is just a merry-go-round of patches and up(down?)grades with each release becoming less good than it's predecessor. At the moment I cannot get any notification of receiving messages and my calls randomly drop out - only reestablishing 70% of the time. My contacts' status indications are rarely accurate. Despite having a 28-50Mb connection.
Microsoft should be ashamed of themselves. I am now going to have to move to WhatsApp - which I have resisted for a couple of years, but now my 'experience has been improved' in Skype to the point that I give in."
Skype	1	2019-04-02T22:51:38Z	time for you to ligma balls
Skype	1	2019-04-02T19:31:16Z	"Bad. Constantly needs to reinstall. Password reset texts don't arrive. 
Really inconvenient to use across multiple devises. Was good once."
Skype	1	2019-03-22T20:13:49Z	"Skype was reliable back when I purchased a phone number, 13 years ago. Now the software is so slow that when I try to answer the phone, the caller gives up and hangs up before the software responds.

Also, there is no way for the notification number to go away, when there is a new message. Once you get a message, the number stays with the Skype taskbar icon until you shut the software down, no matter how many times you open the chat with the new message.

Because of the software issues, I'd have dumped this service years ago, but the phone number I purchased is the contact number we gave a lot of companies and vendors."
Skype	1	2019-03-21T14:22:52Z	charged me twice on my subscription when i tried to complain they said they can only deal by chat and said if they refunded me i would lose my Skype number DO NOT USE THEM FOR NUMBERS
Skype	1	2019-03-21T14:20:09Z	"I am a paid subscriber and have been with Skype for several years. I am a desktop user. When Skype 8 came out I kept switching back to Skype 7 because version 8 was terrible. No individual chat windows, no customizable hot keys, could not resize the text input area, no font choices like font face and size. They eventually rolled out split window but only for the huge clunky windows 10 app and not for the desktop version.  Finally they forced users clinging to their fully functional version 7 into the terrible version 8 which lacks so many features of version 7 that it's not an ""upgrade"" at all it's a serious downgrade. They are not listening to the users who have voted highly on Uservoice for either the return of version 7 or to add the missing features into the version 8 desktop client (not the app).  This is unacceptable for people who paid for the service and for people who use this product for work and cannot get usual tasks done because some of the features they rely heavly upon have been removed."
Skype	1	2019-03-21T09:48:15Z	Seriously Microsoft this is so sad. I usually dont write reviews but this app was bothering me know for months. First of all is the new UX design totally retarde d. I am a paying customer for Skype to Phone and took me a long time to find out how to even make a phonecall. The whole UX is very unpleasant. Then once i forgot my password. OMG what a drama to recover it. Had to solve some weird puzzles and then choose a password that i never used before. Who came up with this??? Thats the reason why people forget their passwords if you make them choose weird ones. Anyway now the design changed again and i am trying to pay for my Skype to Phone credit since its almost on 0. But guess what? I cannot find it. I am switching between the microsoft account and the skype account and i cannot find where to make the payment t. I only see the ret arded option to add 5 USD via auto recharge. But thats not what i want. Seriously guys, what a major fuckup. Totally lost my patience. I already thought that maybe i am just to stupid but then i check the reviews here and everybody has the same problems. Microsoft this is so sad. I was using your software since i was a child. Playing Fifa 98 on my Windows computer and so on. Everybody at my company already switched to Apple but I was like no I am used to Windows and i love it. But after today i am done with you Microsoft. Nice fucku p, seriously....
Skype	1	2019-03-19T10:44:12Z	biggest .... in the human history
Skype	1	2019-03-16T17:34:50Z	My exerience with skype is terrible. I had 2 skype accounts and skype deducted 10 Euro every month since 2017. As I cannot log into my old account I was not able to stopp the payments. The customer service was terrible. After nearly 2 hours on the chatline - eventually they said that they would stop my payments. I am still not able to log into this old account despite giving them all information. (Payments transaction numbers etc. I have lost a lot of money and will probably never see it again. I will not use Skype anymore as it is really a scam. They prey on vulnerable  people and make is so difficult to deal with. It took many times before I managed to get a customer chat person. Did not work on my PC.  Kept saying there is an error etc. All types of excuses and technical issues. . Stay away from Skype is my advice to anybody. I am using Tesco now. Calls are only 1 cent / minute for Germany and many other countries. I hope skype will stopp clearing out my bank account. Not sure what else to do.
Skype	1	2019-03-16T14:54:29Z	"Absolutely atrocious. Microsoft bought up a serious communication tool and replaced it with a social media app for kids. When I say ""replaced"", I mean replaced. Skype 8 isn't a new version of the same program, it's a new, crappy chat app that steals the Skype brand, and they've killed the original Skype we knew and loved.

What makes it truly unusable for a purpose for which I've been using it for years is that I need to be able to access old chat history in an organized manner, but Microsoft has simultaneously taken away local storage, placed a time limit on the history, taken away the ability to ""jump back"" to earlier times, and made it impossible to copy more than a couple of screenfuls at a time. Also, small amount you can copy no longer comes out in an organized fashion with bracketed time/date stamps at the beginning of each message. The copied/pasted text doesn't show dates, and is messy and hard to read. At the same time they've taken this away, they've also taken away the ability to export chat history.

So they've basically limited it to real time chat and SCREWED everyone who was relying on it for record keeping. Sure, we can find other programs, but we chose Skype because of the features that it had, and now we lose data continuity because of Microsoft's arrogance and callousness.

There is absolutely no excuse for treating users like this. Microsoft clearly doesn't care how disruptive it is to people's lives to take away features by the boatload and force unnecessary changes down people's throats in programs that they RELY on. It's not ""an inconvenience"", as their reps patronizingly call it, it has a real impact on important aspects of people's lives. This is not only making me abandon Skype and convince other people to abandon it, it makes me mistrust Microsoft's brand by showing that they can't be relied on to maintain a consistent feature set and they bully their users.

I didn't even need them to continue developing and improving Skype Classic, I just needed them to continue patching any new security issues and otherwise leave it the hell alone. Even that was apparently too much to ask!

STAY AWAY FROM SKYPE AND AVOID MICROSOFT SOFTWARE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU!

Now excuse me while I go and do something I should have done a long time ago...install Linux on my primary computer. And this is coming from someone with an MCSE certification."
Skype	1	2019-03-16T12:14:18Z	"I was kind of okay with having to downgrade once Skype 8 was rolled out, Skype 8 is utter garbage and is missing core functions and feels dumbed down in very unintuitive ways, what a waste of energy and money to make something NOBODY WANTS, you have improved nothing and nobody appreciates what you have done here Micro$oft, how do you not get it, do you even read these reviews?

Now i get a message that i cannot use skype unless i update it to the new horrible sh!tshow, and as i dislike being shovel fed by people who think they know whats best for me even when me and many others don't agree, not allowing me choice in the matter i am going to stop using the application, Microsoft is seriously out of touch.

The original dev team must be so sad."
Skype	1	2019-03-11T01:19:25Z	2 hours wait for live chat to get help with ipad update that does not work, finally just gave up. Hopeless, and useless people
Skype	1	2019-03-09T13:22:32Z	Fcck you Microcock. You are a bunch of useless tosspots, and you've ruined Skype with every update. Version 8 is total kankerkut. Go fcck yourselves, you authoritarian tw@ts.
Skype	1	2019-03-08T04:42:39Z	"If I could rate less than one star, I would.

Skype used to be a simple and easy way to keep in touch with loved ones who live far away. Now, it is buggy, complicated, and in all aspects, AWFUL.

I mostly used it for the fact that you can video call and share screens, and unfortunately, I can’t find any other app that runs the way the old skype did. I am so aggravated with Microsoft.

It is the worst application I have ever come across and I am severely disappointed in Skype."
Skype	1	2019-03-05T12:57:45Z	"How awful is the new Skype?
I cannot count the ways.
Old version worked beautifully Whenever I was running low in my ""wallet,"" I simply topped up and carried on as usual. Now I have to ""Subscribe.""
Internal applications have been moved all over the place in counterintuitive ways.
If I ran my business with the tone deafness and utter arrogance of Microsoft, I would be out of business within a week.
Millions of users have complained on message boards, and the response of the M$ moderators is to say, ""Your concerns have been noted,"" and promptly lock the thread.
I used ooVoo for other users with ooVoo and found it worked incredibly well for users for all over the world, and Skype for international calls for people not on the app.
Remember King Midas? Everything he touched turned to gold. Well, think of Microsoft as the mirror image of King Midas. Everything it lays its hands on turns to, well, do the math, dear reader, do the math."
Skype	1	2019-03-05T11:10:19Z	let us use the old version
Skype	1	2019-03-04T16:03:10Z	In hands of microsoft - skype transformed in piece of utter buggy crap ...long live telegram ..!
Skype	1	2019-03-03T19:02:40Z	"Garbage. Always runs on background, no option to shut down completely since it decides for you to minimise and ""eat"" your computer's memory, just in case someone calls you. (truth is it simply datamines). Heavy app, hugh RAM/CPU consumption"
Skype	1	2019-03-03T02:22:06Z	What a garbage this new version is!! Dont get new message notifications, no option to change the sounds,  people not in my contact list ( not added yet  or already taken off) can still contact me through text .Garbage!
Skype	1	2019-03-02T17:35:55Z	Dump the Skype CRAP and use Whatsapp - a wonderfully intuitive, easy yet powerful product! An end of nightmare!
Skype	1	2019-03-01T19:19:18Z	I have used Skype since it first came out 20 odd years ago. I always loved it for its simplicity. But since Microsoft took over it has gotten progressively stupidER and UgliER and more difficult to use. Until now it is practically impossible to use. It is by far the Number ONE worst piece of s..t software EVER. From someone who once thought it was the BEST EVER
Skype	1	2019-03-01T17:34:27Z	"Absolutely horrible. Microsoft finally decided to force an update to Skype despite just about every reviewer on the web pointing out just how bad the new Skype is, and how much of a step backwards it is

The interface and overall user experience is just horrid.

Oh, and it is buggy too.

Just let us upgrade to the old version; It was better in just about every way imaginable."
Skype	1	2019-03-01T08:16:58Z	New Skype is horrible. UX/UI, speed, everything else deserves 0 stars. Fire all people they were working on new version and bring back the old one. Personally I would be really ashamed to work on this trash.
Skype	1	2019-02-21T17:18:05Z	Horrible. The UI is a joke. The need to constantly update or it won't work. It is annoying. Whoever is in charge should be straight away fired. Horrible
Skype	1	2019-02-21T00:37:48Z	I've used this product for several years and was a big fan. Spent an hour trying to get this upgrade to work, finally walked away - piece of Sh...!.
Skype	1	2019-02-20T03:01:32Z	"Trash and manipulating.
Suddenly, from nowhere does not let you in, when you need to talk to your old mother on another side of the Globe, demanding password instead of sign in automatically as usually, and you can not find it in any Safari passwords or Key Chain Access ... But it signed you in on line to your account automatically at the same time! 
Its MICROSOFT!
I was using Skype since 2005 and went through all changes and let it go to hell finally."
Skype	5	2019-02-14T11:32:04Z	I like skype and can relate
Skype	1	2019-02-14T11:16:30Z	trash update. will never use skype again
Skype	1	2019-02-11T21:28:43Z	Today I was forced to upgrade from Skype V7.4 which was the best version to date. Version 8 is a total nightmare where they have taken away the ability to have your contacts and chat window panes as two seperate windows. Now these are combined where you can only view one or the other! Added to this, a lot of the menus have been removed to make Skype (as they say) more user friendly. I personally believe this is untrue and just an excuse by Microsoft to limit what we can and can't do. Having been a Skype user for many, many years, I have now uninstalled the software and am moving to another product that actually listens to customers and understands their wants or needs. Reading a multitude of threads, Version 8 of Skype is vastly unpopular and Microsoft seem oblivious to this.
Skype	2	2019-02-11T13:26:06Z	"my god the new update is a mess!!!!
lots and lots of bugs, like endless
it gets stuck, it's just not working that good.
and the features.... guys, please just make an effort!"
Skype	1	2019-02-10T17:35:15Z	"Very, very poor Skype!

I have persevered for over a year with constant updates and log in verification issues. It is absolute pants.
The final straw is now it won't log in for me at home and my parent's version is the same with too many updates and log in refusals.
I will now look for a simpler product with fewer features that does not need to log in at all!"
Skype	1	2019-02-09T16:30:30Z	totally ruined thanks microsoft
Skype	1	2019-02-09T09:17:57Z	I used to use it for IM, but the new version is awful and I want the old style back!
Skype	1	2019-02-05T18:31:13Z	"Agree, the new version is hideously bad, makes you click 10 x more to make a call.

Time to find a new VoIP provider, I'll take my skype out a subscription with me."
Skype	1	2019-02-05T15:00:14Z	Hey, maybe don't force people to upgrade to your shittier version, yeah? <3
Skype	1	2019-02-04T14:12:03Z	"Absolute crap, forces people to update to even crappier and more complex versions, blackmails people to force them to give up more personal information, to put up codes and crap.
Everything microbigcrapsoft touches, turns into absolute CRAP!
I hope it bankrupts."
Skype	1	2019-02-04T11:35:47Z	garbage. works ok until it forces you to update or it doesn't let you use it. i don't need those f.ng updates. will switch to another chatting program, way more convenient, more flexible, and issueless.
Skype	1	2019-02-03T17:57:30Z	So they want to make skype worse and worse as time goes by ? bring back the classic version!!!!!!!
Skype	1	2019-02-03T04:53:35Z	"Another company/person needs to build a skype classic replica for all the OS's and devices.

Release it with the same terms as old skype to hoover up all us lost personal and small business users

RIP Skype."
Skype	1	2019-02-02T20:35:55Z	"This new update is absolutely terrible, made an account just to make this review. Harder to use, looks like garbage, something that worked for 15 years did NOT need some ""modern"" makeover. Moving to Discord."
Skype	1	2019-02-02T16:34:45Z	uninstall after 10 years of using it.
Skype	1	2019-02-02T13:54:46Z	Forced to update this. Really bad in every way. I do not understand..so many university degrees and such an application...at least keep the classic version of Skype available -- this is a BASIC human-computer interaction principle. What is wrong with developers and management today...?
Skype	1	2019-02-01T13:09:38Z	"I was using Skype 7 (Classic) and had resisted updating, but this morning no choice and the update was ""forced"" on me-something I am really angry about. Instead of something that was simple, functional and reliable and helped my business, I have something that a teenager might use. Horrible interface, unable to use easily and way to easy to accidentally send emojis etc. Copying a conversation to quote to somebody else used to be a breeze, but now its a chore. Why oh why Microsoft have you imposed this monstrosity on people who (judging by the overwhelming reviews on here) simply don't want it??"
Skype	1	2019-01-31T09:24:22Z	The worst update ever seen, cutting down many useful features
Skype	1	2019-01-30T23:42:24Z	The worst ever update, basically they pushing you very hard to update you, MUST update otherwise you can't use the application. It doesn't matter your opinion whether you want or you dont want to upgrade. I will stop using skype.
Skype	1	2019-01-30T13:23:19Z	"Having been advised I needed to seek a refund of my Skype Credits or to reactivate them, I followed the instructions - which didn't exist.
I then tried contacting support - and there was no email. So a 30 second task became about 40 minutes before giving up.
Next day, 20 minutes in, and I surrendered and tried the customer services ""chat"" again.
An hour later, and the assistant had achieved nothing, but to advise me that in August last year, they were going to refund my credits, but didn't. I never managed to deal with his supervisor, as I was running late for a meeting.
Before I left I asked for them to contact me via email, with confirmation the refund would be forthcoming immediately, as to refuse now - c. 5 months after they said it would be provided was not legal, and that should I sue, they would lose, and additional compensation would be due - as well as the additional costs.
I haven't heard anything, so I am guessing Skype prefer to be sued than honour their legal obligations.
======
3 months later, and the UK CEO of  Microsoft has failed to reply to a message; the CEO of Microsoft has failed to reply to numerous emails; the Head of UK Legal Services was sent a letter (yes, that was the only option) which was also ignored.
Maybe 6 days a week, Microsoft close my case without doing anything, thinking that is the ""right"" thing to do, so I write back explaining that the ONLY outcome will be for reimbursement, as they committed to it, plus compensation, which merely increases as the bullying, delays and harassment increase.
Soon, lawyers will be employed, which will substantially increase their costs."
Skype	2	2019-01-30T06:10:58Z	"Skype used to be awesome. 

I remember the look in my father's eyes when he showed it to me, back when it came out. ""One day, everybody will call each other like this,"" He said. 

He was almost right, right until some update changed everything. Now, it is crap. The GUI is confusing, constricting, unclear. The software is slow and crashes a lot. I always resent when I have to use it, and I'm unfailingly boiling with rage over the software's F-ups by the time we get the call to work (usually 1 hour after schedule). 

This is one hell of a sad story."
Skype	1	2019-01-30T04:09:32Z	The new skype 8 sucks. Stop forcing us to uptade this $hit.. let the ppl use the old version.. fuc*ing a$s $hit skype trash.. I'm going to use discord. I do not want to waste time any more with this $hit program called skype
Skype	1	2019-01-29T16:13:02Z	Why to force me to upgrade to Skype 8 on my cell phone? What's the point to force users to use lame Skype 8? Skype 8 is completely rubbish!
Skype	3	2019-01-29T03:41:20Z	Good apps but sometime crash on my windows os. Keep update. Thanks!
Skype	2	2019-01-28T20:55:33Z	Skype has been outclassed by newer calling software.
Skype	1	2019-01-28T20:33:42Z	Was forced into updating to the new version which faggen sucks lol
Skype	1	2019-01-28T16:38:14Z	Skype 8 lacking plenty of the features available with Skype 7. Complete development of a new version instead of trying to force users of a perfectly fine version to use that crippled web app called Skype 8...
Skype	1	2019-01-28T16:01:55Z	The new version does not suit my needs. Will go elsewhere.
Skype	1	2019-01-28T13:48:40Z	"Microsoft transformed Skype into a garbage app.
I installed classic Skype 7 long time go and had to decline updates every time it asked (There was an option to turn off updates, but MS removed it at some moment), but now it's over - Update or Quit. 
Shame on you Microsoft, you killed a good messenger."
Skype	1	2019-01-28T09:46:12Z	Lousy system - used to use skype as our chosen supplier interface. Now looking for an alternative. Too much screen used for no benefit. Have been reloading the older version for ages - now not allowed too.
Skype	1	2019-01-27T13:34:32Z	Skype 8 is an atrocious redesign cutting down on all useful features Skype had before, being forced on all users now without a possibility to use the classic Skype.
Skype	1	2019-01-25T22:18:38Z	"If I could give negative stars I would. Since the upgrade to V8 on PC the presence status is useless. I have no idea when my contacts are online and available for a call and I presume them the same with me. 

Also Microsoft have an annoying habit on their forums of posting updates and engaging for while on reported issues (such as this) but then lock the thread after a few months but before implementation of fixes/changes they have indicated will be made leaving you wondering if the fix is delayed or abandoned or they just don't care anymore."
Skype	1	2019-01-25T15:54:28Z	Skype used to be a simple, effective, user-friendly app. EVERYTHING about the new Skype is bad. All the useful features have been removed. The new version is klutzy - e.g. several clicks to delete chats one by one!?? Very difficult to do anything. Nothing is intuitive. What happened to the useful symbol 'away'? Now I can only put 'invisible'. I used 'away' when I wanted to talk to just one person.  When I call skype to skype, there is an annoying beating heart symbol at the bottom of the video screen. Very irritating. When I was forced to upgrade (downgrade, actually), names of old contacts I had removed years ago appeared in my contacts list. I can find no way to remove them - only block them. My contacts list gets cluttered with a list of conversations I've made, and I can only remove those one by one. I could go on indefinitely about the bad features. What kind of morons designed this new version?! I will be migrating from skype as soon as I find an intelligent replacement.
Skype	1	2019-01-25T11:41:10Z	Since I was forced to change to Version 8 I have hardly used Skype. In fact I find it pretty well unusable except for phoning landlines. I find the wave feature childish and irritating, and I would turn it off if I could. Skype used to be a great product. Such a shame!
Skype	1	2019-01-24T14:46:22Z	Ever sense Microsoft has purchased Skype the service has gootten worse, the new desktop app is less reliable, they took away all of abilities to save conversations or not, I don't appreciate  the data mining they are doing and reading my conversations. Microsoft really doesn't care about the user anymore. This co-insides with the view on Windows 10.
Skype	1	2019-01-24T01:32:12Z	Why does every version of skype keep getting worse.  ifi wanted facebook messenger id use that.  So long skype, ill be finding an alternative until they come to their senses.
Skype	1	2019-01-23T00:44:08Z	"If I wanted to use a version of Facebook Messenger, I would, but I don't.  Ever since Microsoft purchased Skype you guys have been shooting yourselves in the foot, over and over. MS bought Skype, then merged it with Microsoft Messenger, and they killed that off. That was bad enough, as I used to keep those to lists of people separate for a reason. Then came the idiotic updates that stripped features and controls away from the user. Switch off automatic updates even though what you're using is working flawlessly?  Oh hell no! Trying to use the excuse of security?  Nope, it's not Microsoft's or Skype's job to keep MY computer safe. That's my job. I don't need a nanny.

But this latest stunt of shutting down Skype, and being FORCED to update with this silly popup saying ""You haven't updated in a long time"" or else.  Really?  I checked via certain programs and v7x and v8x both access the same servers/relays, so it can't be you're 'retiring' it because of that.  So KNOCK THE CRAP OFF!  I didn't update in a long time because what I had worked fine!  So, leave off the forced updating, or revamp that tacky, obnoxious, loathsome Facebook Messenger Wanna be GUI and give us the option to have a ""Classic"" GUI, or there will still be thousands of formums with thousands (if not more) readers per forums, finding and using ways to bypass your bullying tactics."
Skype	1	2019-01-22T09:16:58Z	"I'm using skype since 2008, and i quit skype 1 months ago starting using telegram! why? i will summary the features of ""microsoft skype"" as below:
1- crash all your chat history
2- slow chat experience, losing connectivity every 2 minutes.
3- laggy software just like internet explorer.

Thanks microsoft for spoiling one of best software's ever."
Skype	1	2019-01-22T09:14:42Z	"Looks like Microsoft hasn't learned from theirs Windows 8 history. They have ruined the Skype with upgrade to ver 8, and couldn't fix this during the whole YEAR of bug fixing and ""enhancements"". This is soo sad , and makes me so angry ..."
Skype	1	2019-01-21T12:02:27Z	"Skype 8 is a dreadful redesign of an application that in previous versions basically worked although it was never the same once Microsoft took it over.

To say it has been dumbed down would be an understatement. Many things that used to work no longer do. 

Where is my chat history going back years? Why is searching within chat windows useless? Why does hovering emojis not show the shortcut anymore? Why does pasting an image into a chat window immediately deliver it without the failsafe need to press Enter first?

An utterly appalling application that will hopefully be resigned to the scrap heap in the next few years as tools such as the infinitely superior Slack gain more traction."
Skype	1	2019-01-20T17:22:38Z	New Skype is Who Microsoft is today...they hire programmers from all over the world and turn the company over to them. Everybody knows Programmers no nothing about what Users want....There is No chance any serious Customer/Consumer input was sought or used in making these changes and this is what you get from people who don't even use the Software they produce. Smart companies would allow you to keep the old version, but Microsoft only listens to Voices that want new ones...No doubt any New they get will be a Net Loss. Big
Skype	1	2019-01-20T13:40:44Z	"Both thumbs down for version 8. Microsoft writes that the new version has all features from version 7 ..... the truth is that almost none of the important features are there.
Compared to version 7, version 8 is a nightmare that Microsoft now forces millions of users to install if they will continue to use skype."
Skype	1	2019-01-19T21:51:42Z	"I have used Skype since 2004~2005 and never had a need for an alternative but, then Microsoft stepped in. 

Ever since then the quality and usability just kept going down hill, never ending troubleshooting. The few better features of Skype aren't worth the trouble, plenty of alternatives. I have been considering alternatives for a while and Skype 8 finally gave me the reason to move to something else. 

The forced update refused to work for me, couldn't get past the log in screen, was stuck on never ending load screen. With all the troubleshooting i had to do with Skype in the past year i just didn't bother anymore. 

""Good job"" MS team responsible for Skype. They took something that was working fine and destroyed it. With Skype classic dead, Skype is dead. 

From the comments it seems its not just me, but quite a few average Skype users."
Skype	1	2019-01-19T19:16:07Z	Call us overprotective but.... fork yourself ?
Skype	1	2019-01-19T14:22:14Z	"Absolute rubbish.  And being FORCED to use it is unacceptable.  I have already cancelled my subscription.

Cant find an 'away' status for contacts - only green online and nothing else.  I want to know if my contacts are online and away so i can send them a message and at least have the knowledge that they may see it soon before logging off.  

Why make something that was good and very user friendly to a version that has important functions removed.  Surely you should be adding - not subtracting!

Totally disgusted!"
Skype	1	2019-01-18T09:01:43Z	"One of the worst programmes I have ever had. Skype couple years ago use to be a simple tool for calling and they were good at it! Now its slow, not working, complicated, unreliable, integrated system that I recommend not to use. The invoicing system? Ridiculous. If you wanna contact somebody? You cannot, you only get automated messages... Once my license is done, I erase, delete, ban skype from my PC and life.

btw. world unlimited calling to 63 destinations is pure lie as you can only call to 8 mobile lines."
Skype	1	2019-01-18T07:36:39Z	"I rarely even register anywhere to make reviews but i am devastated by the stupidity of the team that approved such a version to reach LIVE in 21st century. This version is worse than Skype 1.0 and i am not exaggerating. And now to the details:

- It is obvious that you have just merged the so called Lite version with the desktop one. The target group of Skype is people between 30 and 40 - this version is for teenagers that do not play around with the chat splits and resizable chat boxes.

- Alt+Tab between the different chats on two screens was making Skype the only usable chat software up until now.

- You have removed the resizing of the reply section, why? Because you removed the chat splits of course...

- The update itself - is your product manager from North Korea? I haven't seen such a MUST-INSTALL-OR-I-WILL-CLOSE-THE- PROGRAM update since 2003. Not to mention the animated actors greeting me for successfully obeying to the ORDER of installing this  downgrade of Skype - all are from different colors except for the white guy who, according to Skype, is handicapped???

- The only positive thing is that you have actually realized that even in non-splitable chats you are wasting my time by making me click on the reply SECTION in order for skype to allow me to start typing. This was relevant for your previous version - now it is fixed and the cursor is there blinking once you change the names - WOW, enormous update!

Seriously at least allow your users to downgrade to previous versions. I assume you have migrated skype to a completely new architecture and this is quite impossible but before doing that your team must have studied the most used features of your program. This version is making everyone work slower than before."
Skype	1	2019-01-18T00:06:53Z	"Skype 8 is just plain horrid, what kind of trash is this?

- No resizable chat text windows anymore? are you serious? i cant type on this tiny text bar, totally unacceptable!

- No split chat windows

- desktop version looks and feels like some web /mobile phone chat messenger, if i wanted to use a phone like software, then guess what we would do it.

- No more multiple instances possible, i have more than one username, so why restrict it in all aspects..

- only preset font sizes? why not allow users to choose their desired font size in numbers, no idea why skype tries to think for the user.

- forced update? i hate when companies force update their (unfinished) softwares, im currently deciding on an alternative, one thing for certain i will not use skype 8 that is for very sure.

bring back skype classic 7.41 it was all good with it, it wasnt broken so do not fix it."
Skype	1	2019-01-17T22:27:00Z	"The new version (8.x) of Skype is terrible.  Version 7.x was great, however everyone WAS FORCED to ""upgrade"" to version 8.x that lacks many features of version 7!!!!!!"
Skype	1	2019-01-17T16:32:56Z	Sucks! Was forced to update from a version I liked. The new version doesn't have split screen. Their solution was to tell us to use the Windows 10 version from the store. That one does have split screen but overall it is even worse. They don't listen to their users at all! Need to find something else to use.
Skype	1	2019-01-17T12:12:26Z	Was forced to upgrade to the new skype, absolutely terrible layout
Skype	1	2019-01-17T11:30:49Z	"Skype once my favorite chat program ... no rendered to being useless!

Today I got finally forced to upgrade from my Skype Classic. I had fended off the obnoxious upgrade messages for many months, because I knew that there wouldn't be split windows for multiple conversations any more with the new skype version  (that's why I had converted back to classic many months ago). Skype was a good program, then MS bought it and every since then there's only crap and problems with it. 

Just an example: in the Android Skype App (on my S8 Samsung) MS has still not managed to provide me with notifications for incoming skype messages (long lists of discussions about this on the internet as well). What good is a messenger for, that does not inform you of new things. 

Just one of many issues to wonder about, what BS are these MS developers creating?"
Skype	1	2019-01-17T01:26:48Z	Skype 8 is as bad as ever...  took a full featured product and stripped it down to nothing.  Will be looking for another platform.
Skype	1	2019-01-16T21:51:23Z	Horrible.. And forcing us to use this new version crab
Skype	5	2019-01-16T10:17:03Z	a Great software for communication helps in chatting calling video conferencing makes the tasks easy
Skype	1	2019-01-16T07:39:42Z	"Not repeating what is missing in the 'new and enhanced' version, because it is just about everything everyone used. No-one wanted anything what they dumped in this 'new and enhanced' version, the one they created because the team 'listened to the customer' - ahum.

I have never been complaining about a 'free' app and some bugs that came with it, BUT ... at some point MS started to integrate it as a Metro App in Win8, which was unusable, so you had to remove it and install the Desktop version (7), NOT 8! The bug was the Skype team, not the program!

Then the updates came ... customers (non-IT) starting to call for support as they were lost in the 'enhanced' interface. Solution, uninstall and reinstall the Classic 7 version and, NEVER update!

So far so good. Now, about 2 years later, some kids at MS developed a mobile targeted version, removing all great functionality Skype contained. Some manager must have found that this was a great idea, not to hurt their feelings I suppose, and MS decide to shove in our throats, whether we wanted or not. And now, we don't even have a choice anymore at all...

Desktop Skype is ignored as if everyone is doing work on a smart phone or tablet! There are MILLIONS of Windows 10 and other PCs out there, used by people who do real work, and have real communications, all day long, every single day. 

And all that happened while MS is still claiming today they 'listened' to the users, yeah right...

The new, young, brainless generation does not use Skype! But still, that is what MS aims for!

Professionals, who build their communication with their customers around Skype are being totally ignored. Those are also the ONLY ones who actually did not mind paying for Skype Credit or get a personalized phone number.

A lot of use are also losing business because of the way we communicated, customers switched and we do not always know to what if they don't tell us!

So, thank you very much to the young generation, who just made sure they will NOT have a job anymore in a while, all for the sake of being 'modern' ...

I fear Skype will just be left to die... Meanwhile, all Skype users are switching to something else, most to WhatsApp, and will never come back, smart move MS!"
Skype	1	2019-01-16T01:15:30Z	None of the features old skype had, really terrible and unusable. And the worst is, I can't use old skype anymore as I am forced to install this crap piece of software. Switching to another program now, I can't mute ringtones, split windows, have multiple call windows open. This is TERRIBLE.
Skype	1	2019-01-15T20:30:41Z	Skype 8 is a terrible excuse for a program, and Microsoft's totalitarian regime for forcing this nonsense onto it's users without any choice in the matter is pathetic.
Skype	1	2019-01-15T17:16:24Z	Skype 8 is the nail in the coffin. Thanks Microsoft for ruining another once great piece of software and service.
Skype	1	2019-01-15T17:08:50Z	"The new version 8.xx is complete crap: awful user iterface, lack of customizations available in the classic edition, slow & unstable.
How Microsoft own product can break Windows design rules by putting ""close"" button on top LEFT corner of windows? Who invented the ugly controls? Shame! Shame! Shame!
After I finish my already purchesed Skype credits I uninstall and don't return."
Skype	1	2019-01-15T15:07:45Z	"skype has been going downhill since microsoft first bought it.
damn messenger pigeons are more convenient today then this malware full of adware"
Skype	1	2019-01-15T14:46:56Z	New Skype is absolutely shocking. Slow, full of bugs, all changes completely needless and have brought with them so many issues you have to ask yourself what are MS doing - do they not listen to feedback at all? Was finally FORCED to upgrade after staying on Skype 7 as long as possible (was cut off mid call and forced to upgrade). In the months since the new version's released Microsoft has done absolutely nothing to improve the product despite all the feedback from their loyal customers and still forces everyone to use this new garbage. Shame on you MS - if you wanted to create a new IM service aimed at kids, why didn't you do this and let the rest of us continue using an perfectly fine and serviceable product.
Skype	1	2019-01-15T14:10:51Z	Unfortunately I can't give zero stars.  Forced to upgrade today and feels like I am 15 years in the past.  The new version just isn't functional.  Usability is shot, layout is awful and features are missing.  Uninstalling and cancelling my Skype number.  Avoid at all costs.
Skype	1	2019-01-15T08:06:36Z	"Skype now will not let me use the skype interface I signed up with and enjoyed; I do not want the new version I want to use the version I have been used to - updates should be optional not enforced
Nasty Business Microsoft Move"
Skype	1	2019-01-14T14:16:33Z	Absolutely horrible. Skype lags all of the time, and also kills my broadband connection whenever a video call comes in. I only know of an incoming call when it fails. Using the search field crashes the app half the time, and the other half it's so painfully slow it's not worth using. The new UI is horrible. This app has failed fantastically on so many levels I wonder if Microsoft is just secretly wanting to kill this business area for themselves by making the program such a complete PITA to use. It's really difficult to fail this thoroughly without trying.
Skype	1	2019-01-11T18:14:59Z	There are so many things wrong with this redesign, many of which earlier reviewers have mentioned.  Change for the sake of change - I suppose someone needed to justify their over-blown salary.  Like many, I will be leaving skype once I have identified a better replacement.  That, at least, should be easy.
Skype	1	2019-01-11T05:43:52Z	its worst should revert to the old one. ill give the old one a 5 *
Skype	1	2019-01-10T21:13:57Z	Worst app ever done since I was born. Just bad.
Skype	1	2019-01-10T12:52:41Z	Being forced into a new iteration of a Skype version that is alot worse than the old one did it for me. I will be using alternatives from now on.
Skype	1	2019-01-10T10:49:45Z	Used Skype for 10 years and now I lost all my markings for people I had... I can't search people trough markings I had, and it's over 100 contacts... Skype is auto-closing now in the middle of my conversation with important people... You ruined everything with new skype and I feel like I'm changing platform after years of great experience.. shame on your Indian employee
Skype	1	2019-01-10T01:01:16Z	bring old version back!
Skype	1	2019-01-02T11:40:17Z	"Someone really needs to cup these devs over the ear and explain the ""if it isn't broken don't fix it"" rule to life.

These clowns have taken what used to be a very efficient means of communication and completely ruined it. 

Firstly they removed the ability to separate chat windows. The previous option to split worked just fine for over a decade so no idea why they got clever there.

Now if you wanted the split screen you have to download the windows 10 app.. now this version no longer allows you to minimise the app to the system tray. Although it runs perpetually in the background.

Honestly I have no idea why they y we used to break something that worked just fine but I guess this is how devs stay in business.

From my perspective, I think I'm done with Skype. WhatsApp provide a better pc/web version than Skype and I have now migrated across to there. 

Would have liked to stay with Skype but I simply cannot deal with all the incompetence from their product team. Maybe I'll return one day but it certainly won't be in the near future"
Skype	1	2018-12-31T05:08:09Z	Skype Windows 10 desktop interface sucks. Slow, shutdown without warning, faultiness setting options and etc.
Skype	1	2018-12-29T02:52:58Z	Never had a problem with Skype until Microsoft bought it. Microsoft forces you to create a Microsoft account before you create a Skype account. I did that two years ago with a phone number. Last month that number was deactivated. I simply wanted to change the number. In order to access my account Microsoft sent security codes to the deactivated number. Morons. So, I go to chat and they confirm my identity but tell me it will be 30 days until they contact me about my security information. Out of frustration I chose to close the account and create a new one. They could not close the account. The rep gave me two options. He said I could contact the phone company and have the number reactivated to they could send the code or to just not use the account for one year and then it would be deleted. Unbelievable. All because my phone number changed. Microsoft has no good system in place to deal with a changed phone number. The platform is slow, stupid, time consuming and extremely frustrating.
Skype	3	2018-12-21T00:13:06Z	"I’ve got a feeling that Microsoft is watching & listening to us every time we make a Skype Call, & might be watching you every time you send somebody a message.

Just like they did with the Microsoft xBox 360 Kinect, they watched & listened to us with that"
Skype	1	2018-12-20T20:29:38Z	Get back the old version. The new one is just a joke
Skype	1	2018-12-15T18:08:03Z	"Highly unstable since being bought by Microsoft. Poor video adjustment quality. Lacks features.
No longer the video chat up of choice."
Skype	1	2018-12-12T14:29:44Z	All other social apps such as Facebook, Instagram, twitter etc has come up with lot new features and update. However the Skype still the same like in the olden days. No drag, swipe options. It freezes often. Time to update soon.
Skype	1	2018-12-12T10:48:58Z	Slow, cant find anything back. Search works not well at all, no drag drop etc etc etc. Get back the old version PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Skype	1	2018-12-10T22:25:08Z	Microsoft literally ruined skype, it used to be excellent but now it's absolutely useless, and there are better alternatives.
Skype	1	2018-12-09T18:54:47Z	Used to be excellent. Now virtually useless. Sound very poor. Cannot connect to services such as echo for testing. Support poor.
Skype	1	2018-12-07T12:18:50Z	"Same as everyone else really.  Very useful & reliable  piece of communication software has now been stripped of half it's features and changed its design to be inconsistent with everything else.  
At least give us something like the older version back and call it Skype business or something."
Skype	1	2018-12-05T15:55:27Z	It was once the best messenger service but since it has been taken over by Microsoft, it has gone downhill rapidly. Constantly getting my account locked and constantly unable to make a call. Why oh why did Microsoft have to ruin a perfectly good service!
Skype	1	2018-12-02T08:13:49Z	The newer version is just terrible. Sorry for the harsh words but... yuck. Not user friendly at all!!!
Skype	1	2018-11-28T13:47:16Z	"Skype used to be the communicator of choice, then Microshaft got their hands on it and pretty much ruined it.
- Can't block spam caller numbers.
- Telephone numbers in chat list
- incoming calls not recorded in the call log

Proper shambles.
WhatsApp is now my default."
Skype	1	2018-11-28T11:56:23Z	"what the hell is going on. I keep having to log in with a microsoft account which NEVER works. I finally got it to work and then they LOGGED ME OUT and now I can't get back in. 
Its so frustrating. This used to be a great system until microsoft got involved. why did they ruin it??????"
Skype	5	2018-11-25T16:14:50Z	Best professional/personal chat software, with a few hiccups, of course
Skype	1	2018-11-21T10:10:45Z	How to commit business suicide? Ask Skype. Force an upgrade from Skype 7 to 8. And it's done!
Skype	1	2018-11-19T13:33:29Z	Had to change back to Skype classic, as the new one is impossible to use because of my proxy settings.
Skype	1	2018-11-13T21:55:54Z	New upgrade is a backward step, not impressed at all. Take us back to previous version at least.
Skype	1	2018-11-13T09:21:01Z	Slow, not user firendly - 10 steps backwward
Skype	1	2018-11-13T08:31:34Z	This is just a piece of crap that costs me time to simply log in to account and never works as it should. It has multiple checks of microsoft account, that leads to just wasting time without any result
Skype	1	2018-11-13T03:01:28Z	"This is THE LEAST INTUITIVE INTERFACE I have ever used. Try finding how to enter a new SkyTo Go contact. Show be easy, right?
How did Skype screw up what used to be good thing?
Find an alternate."
Skype	1	2018-11-12T10:21:43Z	"New Skype is terrible and slow and buggy.
Please just give us the old one back!
STeve A."
Skype	1	2018-11-09T10:14:34Z	horrible! change it back pleaseeeeee the most un-user friendly peice of junk
Skype	1	2018-11-08T13:49:13Z	Nothing works notifications don't work on your mobile notifications don't work on desktop notifications don't make a sound if they ever choose to work. The most critical feature of a chat app is to be notified when someone wishes to communicate with you Skype is unusable nonsense rubbish run by fools, The only reason people use it is because other people have it it is a disgrace. Everybody involved in the development of this nonsense should hang their heads in shame!
Skype	1	2018-11-06T08:08:53Z	Bring back the old 7.1 looks and functionality! And name it 8.0 or whatever you want Microsoft!!!!
Skype	1	2018-11-02T09:45:58Z	Paid for a local number and a years subscription. It doesn't tell me whos called, it cuts people off, it wont let me answer calls. It is ruining my business
Skype	1	2018-11-01T16:11:48Z	Utterly terrible. Why? Well, ain't nobody got time for that; too obvious
Skype	5	2018-10-31T20:25:29Z	It is an easy-to-use, convenient, safe, reliable tool that allows advanced communication between an organization / company or staff, with family members, friends who are out of the country or away from one's location. It is easy to download, it is not very expensive, it can do videoconferences and conferences, useful mainly for business in offices, to satisfy the requirements of customers, remote providers, it is compatible with almost all Windows operating systems, user quantities and have This Tool to facilitate the use between people, you can search through emails. It has had many improvements in the organization, especially in the level of communication, since there are managers and directors of the organization who are outside the country, and through this tool communication with them is achieved through video calls, constant communication with suppliers and customers without Using other more expensive tools, all members of the organization can have contacts with colleagues outside the company. I recommend this tool because it is very easy to use, is available on the website, has minimal costs, improves communication in an organization that is in various parts of the world, with respect to all the members of the human talent that is in it. creates new customers, new suppliers, it is necessary to educate so that its use is the most appropriate, to stay always updated with respect to the platforms of the operating systems in the computers for a better functioning and scope of this tool. I recommend all those people who want to work from their homes to achieve effective communication with their customers and suppliers and stay updated on the future business of the network.
Skype	1	2018-10-31T14:38:06Z	This new version of Skype is 'crap' please bring back the old one.
Skype	1	2018-10-27T16:41:11Z	Trust Pilot need to introduce a 0 star rating.
Skype	1	2018-10-24T18:35:05Z	the new Skype is GARBAGE, this people are either stupid or there is a different agenda going on... either way, Skype is a thing of the past now, no longer using it
Skype	1	2018-10-24T13:04:07Z	"Most people just wanted to use Skype as a internet phone application, not as a social media application. The latest upgrades have distroyed a good product which used to deliver. 
I have simply stopped using it and moved to FaceTime and WhatsApp."
Skype	1	2018-10-24T03:45:15Z	Skype 8 is simply garbage. Unusable, now using 7.40 which will stop working in a few days. Considering stopping using skype at all when this happens.
Skype	1	2018-10-22T03:59:51Z	"Skype used to work great. No idea why all the changes have been made but it's bull. I've been using Skype Messenger since 2010 and in the last year I've lost more posts, *missed* more posts and lost more information than ALL the other years combined. I'm switching to something else. It's F-ing ridiculous. I don't know what microsoft was thinking when they ""upgraded"" Skype but they need to fix it. They've lost me and my friends who use it for *good*."
Skype	1	2018-10-17T17:33:50Z	I'd used skype for years with little issue but I've never needed to reach customer service. Recently my credit card didn't go through for a purchase (not the banks issue as I called my bank twice to confirm) and then when I went to the chat help (you can only use chat or email for support) they took me round and round.... Finally I was so fed up I found a number to call Microsoft who bought skype and they took me round and round too and in addition were incredibily rude, didn't listen, talked over me and generally really unpleasant to deal with then finally told me they'd only work with me through the chat whom I explained were not able to help me and I wasn't dealing with anymore after several days of getting no where using chat support. Totally stupid/time wasting situation.. Honestly, all they needed to do was cancel my transaction and/or take my card manually (which I am not able to do on my end). They didn't need to be rude and difficult to work with. Have lost me as a customer. I'll take my business elsewhere and I suggest you do the same.
Skype	1	2018-10-16T11:26:33Z	If it were possible to give 0 stars I would. This piece of garbage is unusable. We resort to FB messenger now because at least it works! And is user friendly. Restore Skype to what is used to be - and conduct USER TESTING, that is, use people in the real world to actually test it before you put it onto the market. It's only a matter of time before people stop using it completely.
Skype	1	2018-10-11T14:12:43Z	"Every new version of skype is worse than the previous ones.  

I use the desktop version. It's a design nightmare.  Ugly beyond belief. Very difficult to use.  Stupid symbols all over the place, like an insect infestation. Endless useless or incomprehensible options.

One thing is obvious:  the perpetrators of this mess just LOVE to complicate things.  If they been asked to mess up skype they could not have done a better job.   I used to rely on skype but now I find it unusable."
Skype	1	2018-10-09T17:59:23Z	piece of fudging donkey shitnozzle too bad they don't claim this to stay grounded in their fucktrottle product. the upgrades so called upgrades are pieces of fuckcrap man. I mean I never hated anything this much in my life. FIRE YOUR DEVS THEY ARE CRAP IN THE WORST WORD but I can't swear. unless I get creative you shitnozzle cuntdickbags.
Skype	1	2018-10-04T19:59:25Z	"The user interface resembles something from a drunken university midterm project and comes coupled with a way-too-regular and mandatory idiotic update mechanism which requires admin privileges (and is an obvious ruse to force people to ""Microsoft Store"").

This piece of rubbish is, unfortunately, unusable.

We are seeking alternatives to it now, well done Microsoft for being ""clever""."
Skype	1	2018-10-04T15:45:42Z	"Well done MS, if your goal was to kill Skype utterly and completely you've done it with the flying colors. Replacing Skype classic version with that atrocity of the version 8 is a pure business suicide.

Those incompetent nincompoops who are making shots over there should be given the medals for being the worst in what they do. And the guys who have nurtured and developed that monstrosity should be all lined up and mercy shot in the foreheads. Can work other way around as well.

Seriously, the level of pure stupidity behind that company decision is beyond the comprehension of any sane person.

Next time you decide to screw us over before purchasing and taking over another of our favorite programs, please for the love of God consider donating those billion of dollars to some good cause. There are so many sick and hungry kids and since you're already wasting your money at least try to do some good in this world."
Skype	1	2018-09-30T10:51:35Z	worst service ever. Can't download invoice of money I spent. This means more money down the drain
Skype	2	2018-09-27T11:59:47Z	Unlear video quality, bad connectivity
Skype	1	2018-09-26T12:33:55Z	"I have tried to set up a Skype account and it is the worst customer experience I have had in a long time. 

I first try to do so using my mobile number, it says that this number is already registered to an account, which it isn't (as far as I'm aware). As a result I try signing in with the same number and it says ""account doesn't exist""!

I try to remove my mobile number entirely form their records so I can ""start again"". However, it doesn't let you remove a number without signing in, which I can't do because I don't have an account!

Next I try signing in with my email address (which is a personal domain) and again it doesn't let me because Skype only accepts Microsoft accounts.

I try looking for a customer support number I can ring so I can try and remove my mobile number from their system/records. Apparently there isn't one, meaning that I can't create an account with my mobile number or email address.

Terrible experience, I would like to think that this comment will be picked up and they can take the comments on board, however, given the fact I am one of 800+ negative reviews I highly doubt this."
Skype	1	2018-09-26T10:59:43Z	Skype has changed for the worse over the years. I had a bunch of marked contact numbers in the old version of skype, which vanished with the new version, why oh why couldn't it carry those contacts over? Sometimes when I am on a call with someone , there is no history of the call being made after I close the call. I could see their number whilst on the call, and then it just disappeared.  The new version is terrible. Please bring back old skype and just leave it alone.
Skype	1	2018-09-25T05:39:39Z	Godawful. Unusable now. Example: Someone calls, and you can't now automatically add number as a new contact. This should be a basic. Only option given is arranging a group chat.
Skype	1	2018-09-20T17:16:25Z	You've been in business for over a decade. Shouldn't the software work by now?  Frequent problems detecting and integrating with hardware, poor interface (why no intuitive resizing of video panels?). I'm recommending our business find an alternative to Skype for business.
Skype	1	2018-09-20T07:37:16Z	"I don't know what it is, but every release of Skype over the last year has made the software worse. 

In the latest iteration, MS decided to give messages an orange background, severely lessening the readability because of reduced contrast.

Only slightly less painful are the smilies that show up with EVERY message. You're in a serious or difficult conversation and the inappropriate smilie is there every message.

And those are just the most excruciating issues. 

Get a grip MS."
Skype	2	2018-09-19T08:15:06Z	"I have been using Skype for years, which has grown to become a cornerstone for my work. Skype 8 killed all of that with one well-aimed blow. 

Where to start? 

Essential features are still missing (advanced status control, multiple chat windows, adding phone numbers to contacts, compact view, searching within messages, etc). 

I find the user interface downright ugly, with bizarre colors and sounds, and is confusing to navigate. Hey, the interface does not even follow Microsoft's own guidelines for the equally ugly UWP system.  

Last, Skype has gained stupid features such as highlights and stickers - STICKERS?! - in order to copy other chat tools.

There are some positive new features, such as the media gallery, but this is only really needed if you somehow fail to organize downloaded data on your computer.

Skype used to stand out for its sleek, simple, and elegant experience. Now it has been reduced to look like one of many, at the cost of essential functionality. Microsoft, what where you thinking?"
Skype	1	2018-09-18T15:45:08Z	"This has gone down hill. 
Very few things work like one wants and it is not intuitive anymore"
Skype	1	2018-09-17T18:40:53Z	Why change the Windows version to the crappy mobile version just to rival other social media apps? Microsoft, I hope you will learn from this dumb mistake and not force people to use your worse version in the future
Skype	1	2018-09-13T13:31:56Z	Skype used to be great. It is now so rubbish, I don't want to use it anymore.
Skype	1	2018-09-13T12:59:54Z	I used to love Skype but then Skype 8 came to the picture. I grew up with the Skype experience and it got deeply rooted in my day-to-day activities. However, with the newest version, the classic program got stripped out of its previous functionality, and the design got altered (to some extent better, to other - worse). Notifications are terrible, split view is not supported, it's supposed to run in the background but nothing indicates you are online. What a terrible app, now I am looking forward to the day when I will entirely stop using it.
Skype	1	2018-09-10T11:51:06Z	Had to reset my password for skype.  Logged back in and....ALL my contacts disappeared. Completely ruined this once stable easy to use product. Well done Skype! Uninstalled and now using one of the many alternatives. If I could give Skype a negative or zero rating I would!
Skype	1	2018-09-08T20:28:44Z	Good program when it started but trying to up grade the sexed-up version for mobile is an absolute disaster.  they really should test the software before releasing it onto the unexpecting public!  With no option not to 'sync contacts' from my mobile, FOUR hours later it's still not completed - now I know I'm popular, but . . . !!!!!  They really have cocked this up!
Skype	5	2018-09-07T19:56:55Z	Good service
Skype	1	2018-09-07T19:06:41Z	"Skype used to the go-to program for any kind of professional communications. Unfortunately they decided to reposition Skype as a kids app (like MSN was back in the day).

The new version is far inferior to the previous one in almost every way. It is slow, the UI is unintuitive and half the options seem to be missing. It even lacks basic functionality such as the ability to search your conversation.

People need a reliable and robust program that allows for instant messaging, calls, video calls and screen sharing. Previous version fulfilled that need most of the time. The new version fails miserably."
Skype	1	2018-09-07T13:33:57Z	"I used Skype for many years to communicate with my freelancers and clients. But Microsoft managed to incrementally destroy all the usefulness of this wonderful software. Bloated it with unnecessary frills and embarrassing colors the new interface is reacting slow and laggy. The service got extremely unreliable, not sending messages for hours.
Recently i saw an old version of Skype running on a computer and felt this deep pain inside my heart, like you feel when you lost someone. I was not aware how painful it can be to loose a piece of software. Software i am using for hours each day.
If by chance somebody from MS reads this message, i politely ask to remove all the ""design"" from Skype and make it a real, stalwart tool & service again. People are leaving Skype in droves, migrating to other services like slack because they just can not work with it anymore.
If i would be MS i would rather have invested in the screen sharing experience (like adding a mouse pointer or some interactivity) than adding useless kitsch."
Skype	1	2018-09-07T09:41:37Z	Microsoft have ruined skype by turning it into a app. It doesnt even bloody work properly!!!! why turn something working to a pile of crap! its like turning Google Chrome into Internet Explorer!!!!!
Skype	1	2018-09-06T23:51:04Z	About the new skype I dont like i only can see 4 cams, otherwise its okay, sometime we are 8 People in a call, and all are on webcams its a bit sad i can only see 4 of them you know, love my skype family from all over the world <3 i used skype for 8 years i know so many ppl, they dont like the update sorry.
Skype	1	2018-09-06T10:44:05Z	"It seems redesigned by a phone only freaking addict to social texting.  Don't you know ""Windows"" made windows because of the ability to have several ""windows"" with different content at a time ?!!!
I understand the new skype focuses on mobiles. But it at least give the chance to the user to configure if it wants the old multi windows style in the desktop application. Having multiple chats now, is ridiculous annoying. Before you can even have all the windows on screen. Now, back, find, forth, check, confuse, ... awful. And what happen with the ""Away"" status. So handy.  Of course, now they assume you keep your phone with you all the time. Well, guess what, I can not keep my desktop with me all the time! Since I am a developer it is connected to lot of stuff and It won't fit in a backpack."

Their recovery process involved me having to specify the date that I first installed skype, to the month. I couldn't remember the year that I installed it - I hadn't used it for 2 - let alone the exact month. So even though I could name all my contacts by first and last name, and email, from memory, and obviously had access to the email address I signed up for skype with and was using it for this recovery process, they wouldn't let me back in. Because I couldn't remember the exact month I first installed it.
""Oh yes, now I'm likely to sign up for another account on this competent application from this competent company"" — said no one ever."
Skype	1	2018-08-28T10:09:19Z	Utter rubbish. In fact I'm thinking much harsher words than that but feel it best not to use them here.
Skype	1	2018-08-26T17:08:10Z	"Unfortunately, zero points is not possible. SKYPE has been a staple communications and meeting application for many years, until the then labelled 'classic' version was force-replaced by something unusable. No parallel chat windows, no easy way to interact with multiple contacts, and an interface that seems to be designed as a throwback to Windows 3.1 days. How this has been rolled out and survived usability testing is beyond me, but unless this mistake is corrected, SKYPE will no longer be viable for business or personal use for me. Simple fails such as not being able to customise a view (e.g. ""online contacts"") to be persistent when switching to a conversation and back are so disruptive that I cannot recall any worse designed GUI for any software in many years."
Skype	1	2018-08-24T12:00:48Z	"These guys have so called 'tough' tech interviews to hire top of the top engineers. That's the add of it. The real thing is that they are all dump, stuck at the bottom of their own dumpiness, without being able to see anything out of their Plato's cave. Here is the prove: the new skype.

P.S. They lost the embedded segment, the mobile segment, and soon they going to loose the PC segment, Their OS Is an over-bloated API collection that it can be fixed only by their AI machine learning, you know the one they pretend they have, the one which it could not fix the Word, which keep crashing after 30 years of 'spaghetti coding' ... he he he what a dark joke... he he he, I cannot stop ...:))  :)  :)  ..."
Skype	1	2018-08-24T11:31:10Z	Unbelievable since panopticon company microsoft start 'writing' code. On my samsung TV stop working, on my Linux machine is a mess, under windows crap 10 is a UI mess with no logic, I cannot find any options. Looks like is designed by some asylum institution...
Skype	1	2018-08-21T23:57:29Z	The latest Version of Skype is dreadful, I uninstalled it, downloaded the original stable version 7.40.0.151.msi installed this version and it works perfectly as the original version, if you do this go to options and disable software automatic updates.
Skype	1	2018-08-21T10:43:11Z	"Skype needs to be updated!!!
Previous versions of Skype were far better. Skype has become a **** app since Microsoft has taken it! Trouble connecting (username)... took too much time; lost my interview!!!"
Skype	1	2018-08-21T08:28:48Z	bloated crashing always sending piece of dungaroo doo doo
Skype	1	2018-08-20T22:13:02Z	Dreadful interface, user hostile on PC.  Presence no longer works properly.
Skype	1	2018-08-20T07:44:05Z	"Earlier on we could log in to Skype with our different user names and now that's not possible. Accounts that I've added money to and that I have lost now!!

Now that isn't possible and I can't even log intro Skype with my office365 - NOTHING happens!!!

I decided to not used Skype years ago and today where I needed to call abroad, I know why I stopped using Skype!"
Skype	1	2018-08-19T17:39:11Z	"This version of skype has zero customization, and the interface is ugly as sin.  This version also no longer allows for window conversations to pop out so you can only do one conversation at a time.  Honestly they are killing skype faster than they are fixing it.  This latest update is clearly a sign of a company that no longer cares about the quality of their program nor stability and usability.  Their just doing what they want and we have to scream as loud as we can at them to get them to listen.  If they had to only use their own products they would feel the same way we do, it would be hell in their offices.  I bet any of them use discord or some other app, so all in all I give this program as it is a 1 star rating.  Use skype classic if they do not threaten it's existence with a set expiry date again like whining children not getting their way.

Before you try to change the program fix it and fix what is wrong then work on making it look how you want.  If you can't fix what you broke, then why bother?  Fix the contract list issues, fix the chat history issue, fix the lack of customization, fix the program and then make sure we are happy as well as YOU ARE."
Skype	2	2018-08-19T11:34:47Z	Latest Skype version (8.28 Win10) is unbelievably bad. Can't believe Microsoft quality control is this bad. Why make program this important worse by each version? Many years ago Skype was working perfectly fine. Now contact state is unreliable, status message line is not shown, chat is sometimes broken, Skype does not remember contact list settings, etc... Ok, If you can get video chat working, then connection is satisfactory. Bu please, make Skype better!
Skype	1	2018-08-19T09:05:16Z	"It´s the worst skype version I´ve ever worked with.
-In a skype call it´s almost impossible to chat with others and see all your contacts?!
- searching through a specific chat...It´s not possible anymore. Now there is a global search which searchs through everything...I really don´t get it...

Those are only 2 of the things which are really annoying me. 
I want the old version back."
Skype	1	2018-08-16T11:30:53Z	"I use Skype for work for more than 10 years .
This new interface is impossible to use for me.
i can't have a window per conversation anymore plus closing it kill the application instead of just minimizing as it used to.
I can't afford security risk linked with downgrading to previous version so I'm actively looking for another solution."
Skype	1	2018-08-16T04:21:33Z	My account was blocked and I never managed to get it back. I lost all the credit on it and the live chat agent could not solve the problem, so had to create a new one.
Skype	1	2018-08-15T16:44:48Z	I am sorry, but the new update for MAC is just HORRIBLE!
Skype	1	2018-08-15T08:44:31Z	The recent update is very difficult. The last version was great and really user friendly, why have you made so many changes for the worse? Bring back the old version!!!
Skype	1	2018-08-14T22:17:11Z	"Skype used to be tele-contactable, helpful and easy to use. I think Microsoft is trying to kill it by making it as user-unfriendly and remote as possible. As a multiple stroke victim (7 in 18 months) with limited manual dexterity, typing on live chat is exhausting and difficult (made more so than necessary by the tiny window a customer has in which to explain his/her problem.  The message is clear:""GO AWAY, we're not really interested in your problems with our now-restricted service!"""
Skype	1	2018-08-14T21:59:35Z	I am sure that whoever is in charge of Skype wants to drive all the users to some other product as successive updates have made this once great program almost unusable. All of the control has gone. All the user settings are gone. All the bells and whistles that made the program great are replaced by unfriendly unhelpful screens and a generally amateurish look and feel. Way to go Microsoft!
Skype	1	2018-08-14T18:20:36Z	The new Version is horrible - How could this have happened. Everything is completely trashy. No overview, bad design no control over any function... The whole thing feels like clicking in Hell.
Skype	1	2018-08-14T17:10:17Z	"New Skype i awful and no chance to customize. And I don't like when someone says ""you MUST install something new because we did ANOTHER version of Skype..."" That why I'm going to install Slack. Bye bye Skype."
Skype	1	2018-08-13T23:03:48Z	"The Things missing I noticed was no ability to change font size and when you block someone temporarily, they disappear from your friends list and there is no way to get them back.

If this is where skype is going, all it's users will be finding other platforms.
It felt bad enough when BIG BROTHER bought Skype.
Now they want to make it worse?"
Skype	1	2018-08-13T16:32:36Z	"Microsoft, what are you doing? Those who launched this, don't use Skype, do they? 
It's a terrible version. It lacks possibility to customize it or set it up, and this on top of a very bad UI. 
Just few examples:
- You don't go away automatically, when you are off (not even such status exists).
- No more compact vs complete view. The pseudo compact view takes 1/3 of my screen + you need to click at least twice! to change the screen from one contact to another (as you need to go through the main list). 
- Chat notification is a complete mess. 
I could continue, but you got the point.
Honestly, I'm giving this star, because I cannot write a review without it!"
Skype	1	2018-08-13T03:45:03Z	this new update is like going back to 1995, totally unuseable, gave it 1 star as there are no negative stars
Skype	1	2018-08-12T14:23:08Z	Why have they messed around with Skype again! There is no way to add contacts to the new version,, no way to see how to make calls.  I HATE IT! What was wrong with the last version?????????
Skype	1	2018-08-10T17:03:56Z	"Used to be a great app that worked perfectly, until Microsoft bought it out.
Since then they 'improved it' by adding over zealous noise-cancelling which will cancel out the conversation if there is any background noise. They've added more features that no-one asked for or needed making the installer pointlessly bloated.

Their support is terrible, as in non-existent. You can give feedback which is completely ignored. You can email them but they never reply.

The latest update (the worst version ever) has an unnecessarily larger single all-encompassing GUI which now won't let you have more than one chat window open, or have a chat window AND your contacts viewable without expanding huge window open.

Worse, if you try to install any previous version, it will claim it 'can't connect' - of course it can connect, but it's forcing you to 'update' to the new crappy 'limited use' version.

If you're looking for a reliable Vid/Voice/Chat client compact minimalist GUI, it's definitely NOT Skype !!"
Skype	1	2018-08-09T16:55:46Z	"I am not sure why would you change something which was absolutely amazing to absolutely crap! Skype's latest version is the worst version ever and I am saying this after having been using Skype on a daily basis since 2010!

The only reason why they would make it worse is to push people to get the more premium paid version of it or they may be coming up with a new product and want people to jump on to that. 

If this is not improved soon, Skype will be history soon!"
Skype	1	2018-08-09T09:37:58Z	"Extraordinarily inefficient, badly run and unhelpful. Skype seems to have gone to the dogs since Microsoft got involved - they don't respond to any requests for help and they make it almost impossible for you to sign in and use their services conveniently, though they are of course only too happy to take your money.
    Altogether appalling customer service - much like their parent company Microsoft who claimed to have lost all of my emails and who then spent over 45 hours on the phone with me trying to persuade me that yes they could restore them, but failed utterly."
Skype	1	2018-08-08T16:04:50Z	"Unbelievably obnoxious and not personalized service. If you don't have a problems it works ok. However,  if for any reason you stuck,  technically or financially, you screwed. 
I had yearly subscription for unlimited calls. They suspected some fraud activities for whatever reason is. It took me 6 months and 4 hours of calls to remove the block of the account. Guess what, I requested to extend the subscription for 6 months that were paid for but unabled for use, they said NO. No explanation,  but ""unfortunately we won't extend and won't prorate"". Simple NO. 
Microsoft is obnoxious and ignorant empire, where customers worth nothing."
Skype	1	2018-08-08T15:57:54Z	"There was an issue with my Skype account that prevented me from gaining access. This was not a fault on my part and after several emails and calls to try and sort out the situation, Skype were still unable to grant me access. 

Not only did I loose my network of contacts, many of which I will not be able to find again, but I also lost over £20 of credit to which Skype refused to reimburse tor transfer to my new account. 

Very poor!"
Skype	1	2018-08-08T15:50:27Z	I cant see any of my contacts online, its horrible to use, I want the old good skype back!!!
Skype	1	2018-08-08T15:15:42Z	"I have been using Skype for many years. Skype 8 is just awful. However, you can reinstall Skype 7 over the new version. If you do not have the old installer, search for SkypeFullSetup.exe or skype_7.40.0.104.exe and install that. Do not upgrade again. There's a short announcement for Microsoft on a Skype support forum that the 1 September 2018 deadline no longer applies.

Why is it bad? Uses huge amounts of screen space;many features of Skype Classic are missing. You cannot use a headset and have it ring on the PC speakers."
Skype	1	2018-08-08T13:57:43Z	"Dear God MS. What are you doing???
Skype was a wonderful product until the last few years. The ""upgrades"" and ESPECIALLY the UI now is terrible. TERRIBLE. Why the hell don't you TEST with your loyal users BEFORE you send the product out? My whole company has used Skype for years and we almost live on the thing. But now.... we are all uniformly scrambling to find another system.
You simply MUST let pro users be able to customize the UI. All the things people complain aout the new UI below are real and true. WHY WHY WHY do I have to be SUPER-CAREFUL now that I don't hit ""Enter"" or the message simply flies out to the recipient. CTRL-Enter should still be available. There are DOZENS more examples. Even the SOUNDS now are super-annoying.
Please get back the Ver 7 functionality. Revert to the code that worked, PLEASE. I've used this product since the very beginning and it's a crying shame what you are doing to what was a perfectly wonderful program. I *will* change (and so will my entire company) if this does not get sorted. So, so so sad. Sigh."
Skype	1	2018-08-07T23:43:20Z	"If I could give less than 1 star, I would. 

Skype used to work, then Microsoft bought it, now it's one of the worst programs I've ever had the displeasure of using. The state of Skype 2018 is simply unacceptable. If I could find the person or people responsible; I would choke the life from their throats."
Skype	1	2018-08-07T13:42:42Z	Skype 8 is a big pile of horse S**T. The UI is horrible and they have stripped off most of the customizable options. Reverting back to 7 until supported and if they don't fix this s*** will change the program with something else...
Skype	1	2018-08-07T10:06:37Z	"Only Microsoft could take a product and degrade it to such an abysmal level.

Simple things, like the option to send a message using ctrl-enter instead of 'enter' have gone. Now if you want to send more than one paragraph in a message you have to remember that you cannot just hit 'enter'. Just how dim do you have to be to deprecate a very needed feature for many.

The new version is inflexible with many configurable options gone. Why would anybody take away features?

You can't even have chats in separate windows or control how your online presence is managed.

Awful."
Skype	1	2018-08-06T22:00:44Z	Really bad new look, no search option inside the chat, slow, confusing
Skype	1	2018-08-06T15:57:56Z	"To be honest the new Skype Version 8.x is horrible it looks unclear and confusing. Before it was easy and instant to see which groups are active and actual, which users are online or away, text was easy to read for eyes. Now everything is overcomplex and filled with unnecessary text. Graphics and Colors and fonts are completely chaotic and disturbing while reading.

It really seems the new microsoft era is: buying tech companies and distroy them. Same happened with ""Microsoft Phone aka Nokia"".

How can you change a software in a way that i get so uggly and unpracticable that clients will not gonna use it anymore. It seems they hire outranged Google and Apple guys to make their application look modern and fancy but MS Managers are too incompetent to understand: if you hire bad people (even if they have 10 PhDs) they will completely distroy even stable working MS software. Secondly if you hire cheap fresh IT students and put them into work teams they will distroy your last working software aswell (see skype 8.X)!

To the Management: How can you accept a dev. Team to change a major product in a way that is looses their entire userfriendly interface?

If they are not doing a 180° turn around it seems to me its time to start alternative solutions. Im 99% sure most of the skype clients will agree on the fact MS is loosing a lot of skype users and activity if they are not able to get the 180° turn and change the software as it was at Version 7.X!"
Skype	1	2018-08-06T06:43:59Z	extremely terrible new design and microsoft is not listening to customers. now they are pushing to get new skype version with that terrible GUI because old version will be discontinued. this is completely terrible!!
Skype	1	2018-08-05T13:12:56Z	dear skype, please bring back the old version for windows. the one where you can take screenshots and where calls really work. me, 15, just wants too see her boyfriend but can´t because skype wanted to update itself .-.

Skype	1	2018-08-03T12:41:53Z	"I've used Skype for years, with only minor problems here and there. Overall I would have rated it 4-5 stars until the latest update. I'm simply going to uninstall it now and use WhatsApp for video chats instead. 
When I make a call, the big picture (video) on my monitor is of myself - the small video image in the upper right corner is of the person I'm talking with (the opposite of how is used to be). Sometimes, the other person only sees my profile picture on their monitor (again, on the small video image on their computer), despite the fact that my video icon shows it's active. Sometimes, if I double click the image on my screen, the larger video will revert to that of the person with whom I'm speaking, as it used to be.
The Skype icon no longer shows up on my taskbar when I'm not actively using the program. It took me days to find out how to get my contacts to display as they used to. I've never seen such a dramatic failure of an update!"
Skype	1	2018-08-03T12:22:45Z	Total junk - forget it, dont upgrade !
Skype	1	2018-08-03T11:06:04Z	A bunch of amateurs. Every update just makes it worse.
Skype	1	2018-08-02T14:12:00Z	"This is the worst upgrade of skype ever. Needs to go back to the way it was at least it was usable not it is one big nightmare.

Skype	1	2018-08-01T09:23:41Z	The new skype is crap. It calls by itself. It can't be split in different contact windows. The old one was very good 5 stars. Why did you have to go and ruin it??
Skype	1	2018-07-31T12:23:36Z	New Skype is confusing, hangs and wants to take over what I do ... when I have used Skype for many years and was perfectly satisfied with how it worked before, leaving me in control
Skype	1	2018-07-31T09:08:30Z	I installed the update and lasted a week before rolling back to v7. It's hardly usable, is cluttered, the do not disturb status is gone and you can't search within a conversation. Apparently older versions won't work after the 1st September, so good luck everyone!

Don't worry, if you do not want to use the current version of Skype you just have to ignore the pop up that is asking you to update to new version."
Skype	1	2018-07-30T10:15:11Z	When you think that Microsoft cannot ruin another product, here they are. Utter crap. Avoid update at all costs and by all means.
Skype	1	2018-07-29T14:06:25Z	Lets all thank microsoft for ruining another app, absolute horrendous sh*te
Skype	1	2018-07-29T04:40:07Z	"I've used Skype for the past ~8 years and this new update is just god awful. Old skype used to show the names and statuses of people in group chats. Now it says that there are X participants, and I have to click on it to see who's even in the group, and even in that window, it doesn't show any status update for anyone who isn't online. I want to see that people are offline/away/busy, don't lump them all into a non-existant indicator. 

When group video chatting, it forces you to either pick one person to focus on, or have everyone 'optimized' to fit the window. If they aren't centered to their camera you just can't see them. Why cant I have the option to see EVERYONE's FULL CAMERA, even if it would be smaller. Why can't I adjust the size of the chat box when I'm in a call?  

So many useful features from the old skype have been stripped away leaving this un-customizable, frustrating-to-use shell of an app. 

It's like skype felt threatened by Discord's increasing popularity, tried to rush out an update and completely dropped the ball."
Skype	1	2018-07-28T18:53:23Z	"Ok, I'm fed up with all the ""improvements"" that just make this more and more useless. Does anyone remember the first version of skype where things just worked, you could be offline or away at choosing, calls just worked, you knew when messages where delivered and it didn't take up the whole screen of a tabled to view things.

Vote up if you want to join a group of people to write a rival piece of software"
Skype	1	2018-07-28T14:46:04Z	"After more than 10 years of using Skype as the go-to communications platform I'm now forced to update to the dreaded ""new"" update since older versions will stop working.
It has terrible design that lacks some of the most basic functions. Good job destroying one of the biggest and best communication platforms for no reason and making long-lasting users switch to alternatives."
Skype	1	2018-07-28T07:00:08Z	Interface got a lot worse. Worst thing is, you can't see if someone is online unless their skype window is active. Are they killing skype on purpose?

Skype	1	2018-07-27T01:14:18Z	Used Skype since beta version 2003, since 2009 the products has deteriorated to the appalling App it now is.  If Google Duo was available for the PC, Skype would disappear very quickly
Skype	1	2018-07-25T14:01:50Z	Shockingly bad, how to annoy customers. Skype 8 clearing designed by the computer illiterate for the computer illiterate. let's hope the Skype 8 managers soon find themselves out on the street.

that's what  this new update is for skype.
how can anybody in their right minds remove more features than they add and have the audacity to say ""yeah, this is an update"" 
in my experience, here's everything i've noticed wrong with this new skype:
-way slower, whether you have a high end computer or just a laptop, your messages are gonna take 3 seconds to send before they show up in chat, you're not gonna see new messages pop up until they load for about 5 seconds, the entire interface is slow, clicking on things is laggy, it's just slow 

-an unacceptable amount of cut content. They removed so many options,  and added maybe 3 new useless things.
i can no longer choose the font i wanna use, no longer adjust my notification settings, no longer send 3 min. video messages, no longer change my audio settings, no longer turn off emoji's
but oh, it's okay, you can change skype to be black now
y'know, just as a reminder that there's now a much better application you could be using, discord

so many things are just bad."

Skype	1	2018-07-24T05:47:56Z	It is a disaster like the Microsoft Phone. There is no split view to see the message and contacts. No search option is available & Skype get closed instead of minimizing.
Skype	1	2018-07-23T23:58:36Z	"Absolutely awful. No longer going to be using Skype, even though I have been using it for years. I thought my friend was exaggerating when he told me how many customization options they'd gotten rid of. 

I'm particularly annoyed at the notification settings, where you either have ""everything on"" or ""everything off"". I can't work with message previews popping up in the bin and sounds constantly binging, but I don't see the tiny little number fade into existence at the very bottom of the Skype icon on my computer.

The lack of messaging settings, audio settings, video settings, file download settings - it's frustrating being forced into a clear downgrade. I'm using a desktop PC because I want to be on a desktop PC, please stop trying to turn your program into a mobile application.

I would be fine if they allowed us to continue using the classic version like they'd told us before. But apparently they rescinded that! Back to Discord I go."
Skype	1	2018-07-23T19:00:59Z	"Latest update of skype in July 2018 is a total disaster.  It was forced on my computer by the ..... at Microsoft and has replaced a reasonable version of skype with garbage.  It is not even worth 1 star.  Some idiot has decided that making most of the text grey is a great idea.  It's not as I can't see it clearly.  Try to get your heads around this you MS morons; ""if we can't see it properly, it really is not much good to us"".

The idiots have also been making up ""themes"" as if this any use at all.  You can have faded blue, burnt yellow or something else I truly do not want.  Worst of all, the downgraded the software so the webcam is now a fuzzy mess, out of focus and pretty much less, yet for other applications my webcam is clear as a bell.  Thanks so much MS for destroying skype.  Before you got your filthy hands on it Skype was brilliant.  No danger of that any longer.

Meantime, I will look around for something else and I advise everyone to now do the same.  Microsoft of course will ignore all criticism because they feel they don't need to take any notice of people who use their stuff.  Well things are changing fast MS.  Your market share is down to less than 8% and the time is coming when you will be replaced by something better.  Perhaps then and only then will skype be given a new lease of life when it removed from MS."
Skype	1	2018-07-23T10:31:22Z	"I tried the new version of Skype several months ago, hated it and went back to the Classic version. Now I'm being forced to use the new version (from 1 September, but I've ""upgraded"" now). I still think it's terrible, but at least I've managed to regain camera control thanks to Manycam.com"
Skype	2	2018-07-23T09:41:32Z	Why all the updates Skype why??? The onder version was fine. Now it so difficult to group my contacts. You only see who is online, not if someone is AFK but still online. I dont get the new design as well.
Skype	1	2018-07-23T03:06:13Z	piece of garbage worst one yet
Skype	1	2018-07-22T22:21:27Z	"I hate the newest update - the controls are moved around (in some cases, hidden), making it harder to navigate, for no apparent reason; and the ability to call up a contact list has been eliminated, making it much more cumbersome for me to ... well, group-call the people on my list. Even a handy feature of call notification - that is a signal that your outgoing call is being processed has been eliminated ... so you don't know if it's going through or not. There's no easy way to see who all you have in a group call ... that is, who has answered and who not (and whom you might have to call again). One of the ""improvements"" is the ability to emoji somebody with an illustration of what you feel... what!? you're on the phone (or video) ... you can't just say it? Oh ... and the new skype can't do my special (foreign language) characters like the old one does ... What's more and worse -- evidently, the old, better skype is going to be eliminated, so you don't even have the ability to stay with it."
Skype	1	2018-07-22T19:22:49Z	horrible this last update wth
Skype	1	2018-07-22T16:26:06Z	Unacceptable experience pretty much sums it up. Having settings to manage all this crap would help somewhat, at least, but there are practically none. Did everyone at MS go full eetard?
Skype	1	2018-07-22T08:01:15Z	"Horrible. A backwards step. They have removed many of the characteristics that made Skype great, and added new ""features"" that clutters the desktop and makes it almost unusable. I do NOT want Skype to show me all the contacts in my database."
Skype	1	2018-07-22T07:28:42Z	"Terrible since update on Windows 10 
Wish I had never installed it"
Skype	1	2018-07-21T22:10:59Z	"If it was not for the message that I will not be able to use older version of skype I would not have updated biggest mistake ever made.
The layout sucks, status sucks(removed some options there), cannot adjust some screen settings for it, it's just a very horrible experience, if I would not have to use it daily I would switch to another app that is much better and reliable than this. Keep us prisoners Skype!"
Skype	1	2018-07-21T20:31:08Z	Horrible. Stupid emoticons and music. No real influence in settings. Terrible performance. Interface is too fluid and deigned poorly.
Skype	1	2018-07-21T14:05:03Z	Worst update ever...I don't want phone version on pc
Skype	1	2018-07-21T13:56:53Z	"More of downgrade than an upgrade.
Had Skype since it first came out and has always been quick easy to use and navigate.  

Now it has been updated it is the biggest load of rubbish almost unusable,

Why fix something that was not broken"
Skype	1	2018-07-21T12:17:15Z	Upgraded today. Very unhappy with new system. Now have 'unknown bot' in contacts page & cannot block or delete it. Skype is lifeline for older folk like us to keep in touch with far-flung family. very sad & bit scared!!
Skype	1	2018-07-21T07:16:17Z	Layout is so horrible. Older one was much better. Prettier doesn't mean better.This was already gone through when you changed phone layout. Did you listen or do anything about it? No. Instead, you brought this horribleness to windows as well. What is the point of users reviews and opinions if you are not gonna listen them anyway? If your goal was to lose user and push me towards discord, then congratulations. You succeeded.
Skype	1	2018-07-20T05:10:25Z	Cannot show full screen of contact, just has a small picture. Layout is much harder to use than the previous version.
Skype	1	2018-07-20T00:10:21Z	It's terrible i hate the whole layout i hate how it shows my full face before i connect a call, i hate the style of it. Please why force changes that people don't want. Why fix what isn't broke. Please restore it back to original i hate hate hate it
Skype	1	2018-07-19T23:22:47Z	"How did they mess up so badly??

They had such a nice and simple program, and just ruined it with social integration and actively removing features while making it look more and more like Snapchat. What a failure of an app. Moving to Discord."
Skype	1	2018-07-19T18:18:01Z	"Absolute rubbish! Used to have two or three conversation window open at once and could keep track of each conversation - not possible any more as far as I can see......
Sack all the wizzkids, revert to the previous version and stop TRYING to be clever - you are not inteligent enough.........."
Skype	1	2018-07-19T16:19:52Z	The new version of Skype is absolutely awful. It is refusing to show full size video of people I am in contact with. Only shows tiny unchanageable little box if all other programs are minimised. The previous version worked fine, the new version is actually next to useless and as I use Skype a lot now really frustrating.
Skype	1	2018-07-19T00:18:53Z	terrible customer support, they take your money and will not respond to any inquiries and no contact telephone support. Stay away at all cost.
Skype	1	2018-07-18T20:00:43Z	Absolutely hate this garbage software, signing in is a pain, the updates are a pain and the call quality is very low. Use Discord instead please.
Skype	1	2018-07-18T15:29:00Z	"Been using Skype for years... unfortunately the new design is not good enough to warrant my continued use.

I loved the old skype, but I see now that you can't even keep that around... so I'm taking the consequense and uninstalling. DId not believe I could leave without leaving a message about it though... so here we go...
Hope that it will change at some point.

@Skype why do you not listen to your users?"
Skype	1	2018-07-18T09:23:15Z	"Micro$oft's ignorance, arrogance and greedy incompetence continues to mark them as one of the ugliest corporations on the planet. Their destruction of Skype is one of a long list of shameful self-serving and to-hell-with-the-user acts of vandalism. Like many, I feared this day when they first got their filthy hands on Skype, as their modus operandi, that they would rape it for profit at the expense of the community, was glaringly obvious from from the outset. I avoid all their products like the plague these days and suggest others do too. Boycott Micro$oft. 

PS: I just tried out Google Hangouts as an alternative to Skype: it's slightly different but it works for me very well now I have got used to it."
Skype	1	2018-07-18T09:16:46Z	New Skype suck. First of all it is laggy, which classic skype was never. I cannot find keywords in conversations anymore using ctrl+f, which used to be a very useful feature. When you open pictures from skype the open over the whole screen so that you cannot see the conversation anymore. If you happen to close the window by mouse you also close skype. The design is also less appealing, not as easy seeing who is online etc. I cannot see one single betterment with this update. Very, very dissapointing.
Skype	1	2018-07-18T06:26:08Z	"What on earth.... 

Stop. Just stop. The previous bad update was better than this Skype 8 bullcrap! What the hell is with the camera? My video feed has NEVER looked so awful! Please just give us classic Skype back. It's the only one that ever worked right. How can I keep in touch with my family and boyfriend if the one platform we all use doesn't work!?!??! Please don't do this. Please change it back. This is ridiculous!"
Skype	1	2018-07-17T19:46:45Z	I want Microsoft to promise me just one small thing.   Please do not consider buying an aircraft manufacturing company like Boeing or Airbus.  If you did then I would have to drive my car from the UK to Australia for my holidays instead of flying because all the aircraft would have crashed.
Skype	1	2018-07-17T09:39:00Z	The new Skype is useless. Was asked to updated my classic Skype to a new version today and got a very different and completely useless version. First of all the window cannot be resized - so when sharing screen you see it so small that it is impossible to see anything. The video is portrait instead of landscape - and it cannot be changed. Not very useful if you use Skype for video conference with more than one person. Unfortunately, Microsoft has removed the classic Skype from the download page. :(
Skype	1	2018-07-17T08:06:33Z	Bad design, buggy as hell, bad service! The quality of MS stuff these days: JUNK. Guinea pig insider testing.
Skype	1	2018-07-17T03:27:01Z	This new update is the work of a silly adolescent.  Please, return us to the simple, sensible and usable Skype we always knew.  Please do something, this is just so awful.  Everyone I know is trashing it and giving up using it.  There are some choices out there, this is so dead.
Skype	1	2018-07-16T09:12:00Z	"What a shame. Skype used to be one of the major pillars of the internet. Now Microsoft have made it look like the work of a 6 year old kid who has never used Skype before and just wanted to fill the screen with useless garbage while disabling most of the original Skype features. 
No tools, no camera settings no Skype sounds control, no full screen ,terrible messaging, etc. etc. RIP Skype."
Skype	1	2018-07-14T22:06:07Z	"akype was  fine until some evil human hater decided  to ruin it.

itf  you try to make satisfactory  better  you only make it WORSE. I  think  microsoft hate  humans for not being computers and that is EVIL.

where is the toolbar???????????????

why tyhe hell get rid of that unless  you hate  human beings"
Skype	1	2018-07-14T07:36:29Z	Upgraded Skype, don't get messages anymore or getting it late, don't get Skype calls  on time. Can see only missed calls but I was on computer all time. Why it happens on upgraded Skype?
Skype	1	2018-07-14T04:56:21Z	Video calls are absolute Bloody garbage, always dropping every two or three Bloody minutes, and that's if they even connect to begin with.
Skype	1	2018-07-13T06:20:36Z	Just... Stop.
Skype	1	2018-07-12T22:35:50Z	Completely & totally un-useable now. we run a media company and used it to record interviews with it, the new skype cannot be seen by our screenshot and so it worse than bad, it's totally defunct now.  RIP Skype
Skype	1	2018-07-12T10:42:09Z	You cannot trust this piece of garbage.
Skype	1	2018-07-12T07:16:10Z	"please roll back the previous version.
On my PC I do not need a ""mobile phone"" lookalike with its primitive bad interface."
Skype	1	2018-07-11T20:33:22Z	BRING BACK THE OLD SKYPE, THIS IS HOOOORRIIBLLLE
Skype	1	2018-07-11T05:28:06Z	Been loading new version of skype on my mac. Doesnt seem to load. Spoke with microsoft who said go back to skype classic. so typical of a company that relys on users to test their junk software. Never use it again
Skype	1	2018-07-10T08:36:40Z	"What absolute junk the new Skype is for Mac.
It was so simple, so clean, so useful for personal and business use. I am compelled to look for deinstall the software across by businesses and look for a viable alternative.
Good bye Skye I will miss what you were"
Skype	1	2018-07-08T05:32:31Z	On the rare occasion that i use Skype, it has been a frustrating experience. Very quick in topping up your credit but the line connection is the most terrible.  You can't hear anything at the other end of the line! You can't connect properly after trying umpteenth time and your credit is already gone!  So quick to get their money for a crap line!  Never again! Scammers!
Skype	1	2018-07-06T11:03:30Z	"Did you get rid of the full screen option??!
Why?
Booooooo!"
Skype	1	2018-07-05T19:37:52Z	"Just received an email from Skype informing me that 'your credit will become inactive in 7 days', I then tried to login to my account of the same name / email address and, ""That Microsoft account doesn't exist. Please enter a different account"". Credit and account gone. This also happened to my wife, she then created a 'new' Microsoft account in the same name and lost all of her contacts. . . . ripoff Idiots!"
Skype	1	2018-07-04T15:13:22Z	"@Alan,
Thanks for this accurate review.

Peter"
Skype	1	2018-07-04T15:09:11Z	Once upon a time, there was an application called Skype, it was simple, clever, fast and reliable. It allowed people to chat with instant messaging and IP telephony for free and even when we wanted to call a landline it wasn't too expensive. Wakey Wakey, its 2018 now. Skype has 'improved' no end, IM's take hours to send, my Android mobile rings but my PC doesn't, even if I go to answer the call on the mobile, i cannot find the button to answer the call. You have remarkably managed to turn a shining beacon of software development into nothing more than a poo, yet you continue to 'polish' it. I'd go back and get the original code that you bought and start again.
Skype	1	2018-07-04T11:45:14Z	"Absolutely terrible upgrade.

We rely on Skype for day to day business, and I'm often left waiting 30 minutes to an hour for messages to send, the mobile and desktop versions clearly work at different rates, and a series of user-friendly features (like copy and pasting chunks of conversation) have been cancelled. It seriously affects our ability to operate and we are now looking at other software to channel our comms.

How does a company release a product like this and hope to retain customers? And why has it taken this long to fix these extremely obvious issues? What a waste."
Skype	1	2018-07-04T08:25:21Z	"Terrible... It's a shame to call it ""instant messaging"" when you receive messages 2hours later..."
Skype	1	2018-07-03T23:43:47Z	"I have used it for years and it used to work perfectly. Now it is clunky and doesn't sync properly across devices.

It has caused me to miss important messages from business contacts."
Skype	1	2018-07-02T19:20:20Z	Horrible experience. Microsoft ruined Skype.
Skype	1	2018-06-27T20:31:27Z	Used to be our main means of contact with relatives in Australia and New Zealand but now it's absolute rubbish. Once again the arrogance of Microsoft shines through destroying a pretty good program.
Skype	1	2018-06-24T23:51:04Z	"After many happy years on Skype, they could not verify my account into a new Microsoft system apparently.  Many hours trying to fix it, countless emails, personal phone contact, more emails, all unresolved leaving me with a useless account for no reason.  They still owe me account money for phone left behind.... never was a problem in the first place...
  So,  I started a new account, it worked once with my new password, then same problem, Microsoft logo pops up and says they want to do me a favor and require another layer of identification....  I only got to use my account once, then fell into the abyss, no reason on earth for this.  I give up on Skype, sorry to see it go.. Now to close the 2nd account..."
Skype	1	2018-06-24T09:18:01Z	"Forced updates ""to improve your experience"" that will completely ruin your day by deleting your contacts, changing every button s position, removing all the useful features and replacing them with ""you can choose colors now!"" And if you like the version you're using? Well don't worry, Microsoft will block acces of older versions anyway, so you NEED to update when Microsoft says so. The day Skype sold out to Microsoft is the day Skype died."
Skype	1	2018-06-22T21:01:20Z	"Microsoft have, yet again, taken a formerly excellent program and fricking destroyed it!

You should be ashamed of yourselves MS, you have turned Skype into a rigid, unintuitive, soulless heap of corporate junk."
Skype	1	2018-06-21T10:17:49Z	used to work well but now its so bad you cant even add new contacts via just phone number
Skype	1	2018-06-20T09:18:46Z	The worst program to be made.
Skype	1	2018-06-19T09:21:04Z	"I think it's better for microsoft to kill this product or it will give MS worse reputation.

I've been using both desktop and universal app. Both are garbage."
Skype	1	2018-06-15T11:58:34Z	Skype is dead. Thanks Microsoft for destroying the best videochat client in the world.
Skype	1	2018-06-14T11:40:19Z	literally ruined skype, every update seems to be make the service worse which is baffling seeing as its been rock bottom for so long now
Skype	1	2018-06-08T15:29:45Z	"Skype was brilliant, but with each update it gets worse and worse!! 

The latest update May/June 2018 is utter rubbish, stupid layout, big text as if we are children who cant read, and sooooo sloooow!! Also, slower than ever at startup. I reverted back and the older version is a lot better. Time someone else did a service to replace this thing! I would give it -1 star if I could."
Skype	1	2018-06-07T19:30:36Z	I am really disappointed by Skype's recent performance. the desktop version is not successfully compatible with the app version. Everything is messed up and it starts sharing sound on its own. The mute button doesn't work sometimes. If one person share screens once the other cant share it so we have to cut the call and reconnect. Skype really needs to fix-up
Skype	1	2018-06-07T08:38:10Z	"The new version of Skype desktop is one of the worst software ever seen from Microsoft.

Your contact lists made on your own are gone now you can see what Skype Microsoft wants youi to see.

Android version is at the same level.. 

Microsoft is the best company in the world to chase customers away.

I really do not get it. This was a very solid software, now is a very solid C***.

Regards"
Skype	1	2018-06-04T16:35:22Z	"Classic change for change sake and for the worse; presumably a new generation of developers or new management feel the need to make their personal mark on this product, but it seems rather odd that MS are allowing them to turn off so many customers.
Alternatively Microsoft want to trash the old name so the whole service can be re-launched and re-branded as an exciting and innovative MS product.
I can visualise the marketing people in presentation ecstasy as they choose the new name for something that actually functioned very well when many of them were still at school."
Skype	1	2018-06-01T20:58:13Z	This is the gold standard of how to grab a good product and turn it into the biggest crap ever in a record amount of time
Skype	1	2018-06-01T11:15:02Z	Bring the old skype back. Stop breaking good programs for stupid updates
Skype	1	2018-05-25T17:08:29Z	"The new format is a total disgrace !!!!
Contact icons are tiny, have to expand to full page to see their names and on-line status, no options available to change this garbage appearance, HUGE welcome page is TOTALLY USELESSS !!!
Enough? time to switch...."
Skype	1	2018-05-23T13:54:29Z	It's a complete and utter shambles. Things do not get better anymore just worse.
Skype	1	2018-05-20T17:06:27Z	"Skype has called the wrong number in my contacts even when i have explicitly typed in a different number not in contacts on multiple occasions.
Keeps telling you to make call or your credit will expire. forcing you to spend against your will.
Keeps telling you to update
Crap call quality nearly every time.
In short, skype rips you off and the software is atrocious.
Use something more modern not a badly maintained legacy piece of software probably written in BASIC."
Skype	1	2018-05-20T09:14:54Z	"Microsoft seems to have deliberately thrown Skype into absolute free fall. It's passed ground zero and still heading down. 
Passed into hell now...
Going down...
Just bounced off the devil's head...
Going down...
Just bounced off the devil's D!ck...
Going down...
devil's toe...
How low can you go..."
Skype	1	2018-05-18T18:50:11Z	I dont know where to begin. It's like they liberately design bad software. Those programmers and functional designers should be sent back to kindergarten. Of course they will think that I am 'resistant towards change' or whatever they throw in, but no Microsoft, I am totally right. Go and shame yourselves.
Skype	1	2018-05-17T18:23:55Z	"I am a skype user since Beta. And you know what? even beta version was better than this.

crashes, audio bugs and/or crashes, even  OS crashes (although it might be as well the poorly coded windows 10), horrible lag (i have a 200Mbit internet connection) and i can go on forever.

i suppose because the so called ""developers"" are just too focused on collecting your data instead of delivering what the software is supposed to do.

TLDR: we are in 2018 and skype sucks worse than its 2003 version.

enough said"
Skype	1	2018-05-16T15:50:43Z	Spent one hour now just trying to sign in. Keep getting redirected. Reset password but still no skype on the horizon. what a convoluted process.
Skype	1	2018-05-16T13:12:12Z	"If only you could give negative stars.

Skype doesn't have support chat - even though they pretend they do with a round-about of hyperlinks back to the same pages. 

Their products do not function as sold - no called ID function in Australia 

I very rarely review anything but I am compelled to help warn others away from this appalling product."
Skype	1	2018-05-15T18:13:41Z	In the past couple of years, Skype has been upgrading and changing its look without any actual chat quality improvements. I am asked to create a new login, my picture was automatically taken from Gmail instead of using my old Skype photo etc. All these updates are making Skype worse and complicated. I am going to use a software that stays the same (unless there are MAJOR improvements) or I am going to look for another form of communication. Poor quality, Skype!
Skype	1	2018-05-15T09:30:10Z	"Classic Skype stopped working on May for multiple Win10 users including me and I was obliged to use Skype 8.  
In 2 words - this version is unacceptable for work.  I have 50+ chats every day and new Search doesn't allow me to find needed chat. some chats cannot be searched at all (those with ""Name1, Name2""). Searching public directory when I just want to switch local chat is completely redundant.
Dozens of missing features like Copying/quoting several messages, creating chats by multi-selecting participants of existing chat, no search inside chat, lags and crashes when searching messages history, no Ctrl+Enter sending, no hyperlinks in chat names, ... I can continue this list endlessly.
Make Classic Skype work for Win 10 at least!"
Skype	1	2018-05-15T06:14:55Z	Skype has to be one of the only products that gets worse with 'upgrades', terribly heavy/slow app. I just purchased international calling whilst I am overseas to call people for work and the Caller ID function does not work. I then purchased a dedicated skype number and the caller ID still doesn't work - all my calls are showing up as private. I've essentially paid $40 for the ability to listen to peoples voicemail, as not many people answer private calls. Skype also, and i guess this became a policy because of their utterly useless service, do not provide refunds for this .Oh and to top it off their support is non exsistent - they clearly have no interest in helping customers and fob pepple off to FAQ's with loops of hyperlinks,.........If you are planing to use a service to call home whilst you a abroard for more than a few days I would check out VoiP providers speciailly voipstudio. I will never use skype again for calling - utterly useless....I can only assume theyre actually trying to be this bad intentionally because they couldn't do it by accident.
Skype	1	2018-05-12T19:09:08Z	"New version is absolute rubbish. Why ""away"" status has been removed? And  how do I check if somebody is available? Not to mention big chat window without giving a user option to close it. Terrible ""upgrade"". Time to switch to something else, Messenger perhaps."
Skype	1	2018-05-10T21:41:10Z	"Absolute rubbish App for iphone. 
Call quality is terrible and constantly drops. 
Promises to be a phone service i.e. you dial a local number but really it is using 4G / wifi data to a server in your country which then makes a Voip call overseas to a local / mobile number.
Voxofon and Rebtel are far superior platforms with high call quality.
Do not waste your money.
Microsoft should be ashamed of this!"
Skype	1	2018-05-07T20:36:24Z	Not logged into Skype for a while but when i did i found that all my contacts were gone.  My parents have been trying to use there account for a while but failed.  The UI looks crap too.  I'm going to find an alternative now once i've deleted the app from my phone.  byebye
Skype	1	2018-05-07T07:19:14Z	Absolute rubbish now, difficult to sign in. They change the layout every time I want to use it. They want more personal information all the time. I've stopped using it.
Skype	1	2018-05-07T04:38:40Z	It used to be a so much better program but today it's design is terrible and it's bothersome to use. Such a shame.

The heavy handed stupidity then means, as with me, the adult cannot access their account, even if they have money credit. So, one then has to open a Microsoft Account, simply to contact Microsoft, and then they either ask you to adopt the child, even though I am not a child, and in adopting and verifying, they ask for PAYMENT! Yes, the parent, guardian or simply the person trying to get their adult account back up and running, is supposed to give back details or CC card details, and pay 50 pence, just to allow the account to go back to how it was, before Microsoft's thug policing interfered! They only offer an alternative which is to put through an ID request, So, I sent them my driver's licence, scanned. Two weeks ago! All I got back was some impersonal, dim-wit Microsoft email, asking for the ID, again, as they claimed it was not attached! So, this was sent, I emailed from both private email and said awful, new Microsoft account and guess what? Nothing! So, here we are, almost three weeks down the line, and Microsoft doing what it does best, which is interfere and bully, and do nothing! PLUS they wanted money, up front, from an adult, as they accused me of being a minor. The thing is, they are doing this to all non Microsoft members of Skype, and it is so transparent, as they almost force you into creating a new account with them! This is nothing to do with the various adult platforms dealing with underage threats or misuse, this is Microsoft flexing it's bullying muscles again and if you don't play ball, they block accounts, and do not deal with issues! 

This is why I dumped my Windows PC five years ago, and celebrated being free of the Microsoft and Windows grip! So, maybe I dump Skype> Maybe we should all dump both?!"

Skype	1	2018-04-27T08:12:43Z	"I would give zero stars if i could. There are noting in this world that M$ can't crap on it to become useless!
All the useful features - gone. Frequent changes of the interface making it worse and worse. Support is useless. Gathering personal data by all means including forcing the users to scan ID cards to ""proof"" that they are adults, forgetting that this same account was paying for ""corporate"" few months ago."
Skype	1	2018-04-23T22:55:44Z	I have relied on skype for years but now I'm going to have to find an alternative. The new version is a pile of crap and unfit for purpose.
Skype	1	2018-04-23T15:17:05Z	i like skype 7 a hell of a lot better then skype 8 and the only reason i unscribed from version 7 was i was having password issued and got tired of the crap but to be honestly version 8 is twice as bad and i am angered  that by unstalling version 7 i lost all my contacts and that bites big time!  Very frustrated right now may try to go back and get skype 7 again as skype 8 sucks to be quite honest!!!
Skype	1	2018-04-23T12:35:42Z	Skype WAS a great service
Skype	1	2018-04-20T13:04:32Z	"The new Skype 8 for Windows is utterly terrible. What is that happened to GUI design in the industry during last years? We can see a massive decrease of functionality for some odd kind of  ""flat design"" fashion which is not only harder to navigate but also leaves a lot of screen space totally unused. Tons of settings and keyboard shortcuts disappeared without a trace. Quoting is horribly broken. Microsoft, please, replace your hipster ""designers"" with functionality-oriented developers. I am sticking with Skype 7 and looking out for an alternative IM."
Skype	1	2018-04-15T15:30:28Z	Actual crap. It sucks so much. Dont use it, user discord instead. Skype is the worst program ever.
Skype	1	2018-04-13T17:40:26Z	Skype start to demand my personal information
Skype	1	2018-04-07T00:46:30Z	I agree with so many people below - if I could give it a 0 star rating I would! My account has been compromised, the hacker got away with depositing money into my account. The person changed my email address to his, deleted my number and took over my account. Now I've been with customer support on chat over 3 hours (2 sessions) and still no way to recover my account. Terrible service, would not recommend. Skype used to be a good service, now me including all my friends use other - more user friendly - apps.
Skype	4	2018-04-05T02:48:04Z	The skype windows app is good. But really annoying. I can't close skype, it's always on my taskbar.
Skype	1	2018-04-05T01:03:29Z	A product that worked once, but is now very poor. It's OK for International Voice calls, but adding credit to the account is not easy anymore. Not worth wasting time on if you have an alternative package to use.
Skype	1	2018-04-04T14:21:24Z	Great free connection to most people worldwide, however their vulnerability to hackers and viruses makes the program unusable unfortunately. The risk of having your own personal computer/mobile device being controlled through skype, by a hacker makes the user experience very much negative and has made me as a once regular user, no longer use the program.
Skype	5	2018-03-31T21:40:23Z	"Use Skype to call landlines of older relatives in the states. Affordable and excellent quality, as my grandma said ""sounds like you're in the next room."" Thank you Skype, for letting me stay connected with my family!!!"
Skype	1	2018-03-28T08:58:06Z	Agree with all below reviews, that time of good-working skype has ended. Now it is just unreal to use it.
Skype	1	2018-03-28T08:42:19Z	awful. awful. awful.
Skype	1	2018-03-26T14:12:33Z	I had to get on skype for an interview and it literally crashed about 10 times while just trying to pick a screen color option. i HATE the new skype. it's horrible. the design is horrible and it's completely UN-user friendly.
Skype	1	2018-03-26T02:39:27Z	"Skype was a great service until the recent updates, which are just hideous. Can't sign in from facebook anymore, don't have a microsoft account, built a new email to sign in because apparently my .edu email address won't work.  And then it required cell phone confirmation, and I don't have a cell phone, which is why I use Skype in the first place.

Didn't see any warning about the new login system, now have Skype credit trapped in an account I can't access, which is just awful.

After making several hours a week of Skype calls for almost eleven years, I'm finding a new platform."
Skype	1	2018-03-22T19:24:18Z	"Never used it much, so it came as a surprise that it was such crap when I did several months after the ""upgrade""...  Wait, I'm not really surprised, in fact. Microsoft has made some good stuff in the past, not great, but good. However, with garbage such as Windows 8 - 10, it's no surprise that Microsoft can be like King Midas but in reverse. Everything they touch turns to crap."
Skype	1	2018-03-20T23:19:59Z	"So logged on to my Skype today and came up with a ""set-up your account"" window from Microsoft (like..waaat?!)  It went to hell in a hand-basket from there!  I gamely went ahead with it...following all the prompts and inputs...and in the end  the wheels churned and the bells rang and it spat out what I can only describe as a really bad joke onto my screen! I almost puked!  ALL MY SKYPE CONTACTS AND SAVED PHONE NUMBERS...GONE!!!!  I USE SKYPE FOR MY BUSINESS YOU DUMB F*****S!!!  YOU HAVE SERIOUSLY SCREWED UP!  AND THEN A LIST OF MY EMAIL CONTACTS ARE THROWN IN MY FACE WITH THE INVITATION TO ""ADD TO MY SKYPE CONTACTS"".  WTH WOULD I WANT MY HOTMAIL CONTACTS (most of them old and outdated) ADDED TO MY SKYPE THAT I USE TO PHONE WORK COLLEAGUES ON AROUND THE WORLD.  EMAIL CONTACTS FOR EMAIL AND SKYPE CONTACTS FOR PHONING/TEXTING WHAT PART OF THAT DON'T YOU GUYS GET?!  You effin' dumb-asses have REALLY messed it up this time!  The old Skype was perfect for what it was...why the hell are you trying to compete with FB messenger, which is a social contact app...A TOY...!!  THE OLD SKYPE HAD FEATURES THAT WERE REALLY USEFUL AND WORKED AND WAS WELL-ORGANIZED AND HELD ALL MY PHONE CONTACTS. NOW IT'S ALL GONE!!! YOUR NEW DOWN-GRADED SKYPE IS A PIECE OF USELESS GARBAGE!! I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAD TO GIVE YOU ONE STAR JUST SO I COULD WRITE THIS REVIEW!  IF I COULD GIVE YOU A BIG FAT ZERO, I WOULD DO THAT..!!  THERE MUST BE A SPECIAL PLACE IN HELL RESERVED FOR YOU MORONS!"

Skype	1	2018-03-05T22:30:18Z	this is sooo bad that I have no words for it - there is no way to transfer your contacts from one account to another or from your contact list - I have taken   the NEW Skype out of my computer !! The old one still works ok, but DO NOT download the new version - it is BAD ! It garbles your contacts and puts in names that you have no idea who they are and then you cannot delete them - BAD !! 0 is my rating
Skype	1	2018-03-03T16:14:51Z	I,m Done with Skype Ugly interface you can't even change the sound when message and phone call receive
Skype	1	2018-03-02T11:05:10Z	From a great skype application, Mircrosoft redesign it into an application that can not be worse. When you install the win10 now it does not install the old skype on it anymore, it's crazy
Skype	5	2018-03-01T20:28:38Z	We're so used to everything being a battle if you make a mistake that when common sense is taken at face value and a quick turnaround is given one is shocked! I by mistake purchased the wrong skype call package and realised later and bought the one I needed. The lady at first asked for a small verification and quickly reversed the payment! Amazing! So impressed!
Skype	1	2018-03-01T17:33:32Z	"BEWARE HAVE BEEN  DEFRAUDED BY SKYPE.

I purchased a Skypein number for £41.48 in 2016, and have bought cards with it on, and given it to everyone I know. I renewed the subscription in 2017 and have forwarded it to my mobile and paid skype £10 for skype credit. When I tried to call my own number it goes to another company! I rang the company and the guy explained me bought the same number from Skype 10 years ago, and ported it away from Skype 3-4 years ago as they were so useless. So, I go back to Skype to explain that they have charged me for something they did not even own, and am getting the run around by the utterly useless offshore support clowns. I have just been robbed of £92 for something I never received, they never had to sell, never worked, and now I am having to fight them to get my money back."
Skype	1	2018-02-26T16:21:50Z	Skype for Windows 10 is terrible. Nothing intuitive at all. Very complicated and not user friendly. I uninstalled and went back to the earlier version.

Skype	1	2018-02-25T22:13:20Z	"Skype is widly used by professionals or by people keeping in touch in distance, so why did Microsoft try to make it ""social""? There a better apps for that. Real Skype users just want a neat and reliable app. Worst Skype edition, ever. They will not attract new users and risk to loose the old ones."
Skype	1	2018-02-25T04:50:11Z	skype is crap even i disabled auto recharge they keep on charging and also number subscription and when i cancelled it says no refund available though i didn't use it for months almost a year...
Skype	1	2018-02-22T18:45:20Z	"Just like MSN messanger, once mickysoft got ahold of it they tweeked it till it no longer worked so they bought a GOOD working service ""skype"" an have proceeded to destroy it too it seems."
Skype	1	2018-02-22T15:48:59Z	"I deeply dislike the new Skype. Why did you take away he ""away"" option?! now if I use skype on the phone I have to let my hone open all the time if I want to be visible online, do you know how much that drains my battery. before if I was online but then turned my phone off I was still online in Skype and visible and available and people could reach me, now they think that I am not available. I just want Skype to have the old yellow ""away"" option that was so incredibly useful and practical!!!"
Skype	1	2018-02-21T12:09:49Z	Rude, useless etc. asked to speak to supervisor/manager and unable to do so. cant even speak on the phone, let alone actually Skype them? You're selling a service which you wont even endorse for your customer service? hilarious
Skype	1	2018-02-20T21:39:31Z	"No Refunds 

Skype does not issues refunds when you don't use its service, I talked to two chat reps and both times they made it seem like it was my fault. No customer care service number, only means of communication is thru the Chat options and email which was never answered."
Skype	1	2018-02-20T05:31:42Z	Skype ripped off by auto pay.  We got large $71 charge without permission. Tried to log in to cancel.  Got error.  We reset passwords, and new passwords was accepted, but again error message.  Tried again to set passwords, accepted, again error message.  We do not use Skype any more and want to cancel, but their system is not working.  Their help is helpless.  There is not Phone contact we can make.
Skype	1	2018-02-18T07:43:22Z	I do not understand how a company like microsoft can release such a terrible update. I used to love skype, now I hate it. My advice is that we all turn our backs on skype and move on to something else...
Skype	1	2018-02-17T21:36:25Z	"Since Skype is taken over by Microsoft, Skype App became pathetic.

But the major problem is that Microsoft is over billing the Skype customers secretly which I can now call intentional FRAUD. This does not happen just one time but many times. 

For example they continue to bill the cancelled subscription. When I started a chat they denied that subscription was cancelled and I had no proof because I never expected Skype to cheat me so I did not took the screenshot and it never emailed me any cancellation email so I asked the chat agent to now cancel it and write it down so that I have a proof by taking the screenshot of chat and he confirmed that now he has cancelled and it will not bill again but on next due date it got billed again and I contacted them again and they just gave lame excuses and still did not refund the extra billed money and said that due to some technical issue it was billed again. But technical issue was not my fault. It was set for 3 months billing and I can't keep checking every three months if they bill my card secretly or not as I make many purchases with my card. And it is not an excuse to bill me so much more for their system issues. I told them it was cheating and they just said that they can only apologize and refund is not in their control due to system problem.

I have a many numbers purchased from Skype and I can not get rid of it now because those numbers are already given to many clients of ours. We have a Skype Manager account which was promised to get a priority support. But since Microsoft took over, it became a nightmare.
 
Same thing happen again for a yearly number purchase and I got really angry and told them that they must refund the money because number was failed to be registered by their system and they still secretly billed my card so they said that they will refund it because I threaten to go public this time. The chat agent said the amount is refunded in Skype account but when I checked few dollars balance that was in Skype Credit was also gone instead getting my $30.00 back in Skype. So I told the chat agent that you guys are trying to make me fool but he said that he refunded it to my card and all amount will show on my card in few days. It is two months now but amount never showed in my card and if I am going to call them again they will give same lame excuses that not sure what happened. If I go for chargeback, they can cancel my remaining numbers giving the reason of the dispute. So now Skype is basically fraud and black mailer also. I have started a chat more than 20 minutes ago and still it is showing following wait message and I invest so much time in the issues that were already discussed and promised to be resolved after investing a lot of my time and effort:
==
We are experiencing higher than normal wait times. Thanks for your patience. You're still in line for chat.
==

This is 100% genuine review. Skype case number is 1407531109 

New clients avoid Skype's paid subscription and existing clients slowly move paid services away to some decent and honest company."

Skype	1	2018-02-05T15:39:07Z	"For applications that have stooped so far down to the bottom, there should be an option to give ZERO or NEGATIVE stars. 

Where to begin with this piece of absolute junk. Everything in it, has problems. You can't even copy text rom the chat and paste it correctly. The chat window is too small and you cannot resize it, when you have the call view open. It misscalls contact, if you are typing on one chat and a incoming call occurs, the next key that you tap, will answer the call, weher you like it or not. 
There's no configuration options. 
The only thing missing from the latest release would be an even uglier UI design and some kind of heavy adware. This would make it the perfect all time candidate on how not to do software. 
The notifications sounds do not work. 
The sound quality and general call quality, which ought to be the CORE and MOST IMPORTANT feature are the same or worse. 
And many others issues that I just cannot be bothered to write. 
What was so wrong ith the previous version Microsoft, that could not be fixed?
And, if you had to make it all from scratch, which is fine if done right, why would you choose to release such a mediocre product, long before it is even as good as the previous version? Why?"

Skype	1	2018-01-22T20:06:37Z	I just found out that skype will only refund credits bought within 14 days of purchase. Is this legal? In California gift cards purchased (basically advance credit) can't legally expire, so how does skype get away with keeping money you paid them for credit which hasn't been used? Regarding another issue, in attempting to reach a skype representative through their online chat feature, I waited for over 50 minutes as I was informed there was heavy volume, but I was still in line to reach an agent. When an agent finally came online, I was told they could not help me because a system update was in progress. Anybody who knows anything about computer systems realizes they could have generated a message explaining that the system update was in progress and for customers to try again later, but, instead, their failure to implement a simple solution kept dozens of customers waiting, collectively, for hours. What's worse is that in chatting with a supervisor the next day, he didn't know enough to realize this and dismissed my suggestion, saying I didn't understand their system. Terrible customer service!
Skype	1	2018-01-18T21:17:10Z	"After using Skype since Day 1, I will be forced to leave the service - after having been a paying subscription business user.  At least on my laptop version [the latest], there is no ""menu bar"" and no sign whatsoever of basic features like setting voicemail, checking connection speed - much less proactive blocking of users nor being able to sue the dialpad during calls - essential for long distance teleprompts.  Instead, this is essentially a TOY and the customer ""support"" is simply classic Microsoft arrogance."
Skype	1	2018-01-16T17:03:14Z	In all fairness, I am not a fan of Microsoft, so my review may be somewhat slanted. True to their modus operendi, Microsoft screwed up Skype. Skyoe used to be a very intuitive application to use. Since MS took over, it is more complicated and a mess in the sense that it simply doens't work. Microsoft- get your stuff together. Then again, I don't carewhat MS does- I will no longer be using Skype.

Skype	3	2018-01-12T18:41:44Z	It became less reliable and user-friendly then it was before, definitely. Though still good to use as a free chat with those insisting on using skype, and for calls from time to time.

I'm guessing that my voice calls will continue to be put on perpetual hold on the iphone every time an alarm goes off. I have been a paying customer for years. Now contemplating the annoying project of finding a replacement that gives me back seamless service delivery. Luckily I am still able to download ""classic skype"" - wonder how long this will last!

I am considering dropping it as I and my family are using it less and less everyday. This is a heads up Microsoft, take your head out of the bucket and look around. Hire some quality engineers instead of cheap ones that you think are talented, -obviously they are not- and your recruitment process should be reconsidered.
Skype	1	2018-01-05T17:30:46Z	"The new Skype is absolute useless !!!
This new interface make absolutely no sense.
Who designed it? He/She was drunk?
So nice program at the beginning became piece of crap..."
Skype	1	2018-01-03T08:45:29Z	Piece of ... You get it :)
Skype	1	2018-01-01T19:07:51Z	"Skype used to be very good and easy to use. since Microsoft bought it, i is not the most useless program every. we tried over several hours to get something useful from it but gave up.
it is simply not usable any more, so we are looking for an alternative."
Skype	1	2018-01-01T18:49:56Z	"Skype call it an Upgrade, We call it the best Downgrade ever !!!
Don't understand why Microsoft are using idiots."
Skype	1	2018-01-01T17:39:34Z	How is it possible to take a perfectly good app as Skype originally was and turn it into an utterly useless piece of Tecnocrap? It take  Cretans in Microsoft thats how . What a pity ,can anyone recommend an alternative that has not been anywhere the Micros****t corporation ?
Skype	1	2017-12-29T17:12:58Z	Horrible - just take something that works, bash it with a hammer, and then add cutesy colors and squiggles.  Absolute garbage release.
Skype	1	2017-12-23T13:21:56Z	"Just don't use it...
Every update you must search you contacts again. IT WON'T RECOVER!"
Skype	1	2017-12-22T20:14:07Z	"Skype has been terrible since the new Microsoft versions. New app look/feel is horrible on iPhone. Chats cannot be properly backed up. My contacts not logging in anymore preferring to use other chat/call services.

WhatsApp, iMessage and many others are better choices for the future. The only reason I’m still using it because I have credits in my account to use up."
Skype	1	2017-12-22T07:55:25Z	"The new skype is absolute horse $h!t !!!
This new interface make absolutely no sense. This is the worst move since microsoft as bought skype.
It is as if every company in the silicon valley as gone FULL RET ARD !"
Skype	1	2017-12-21T13:08:27Z	I give the new Skype -5 stars. Now I have lost all the contacts I had and the connection is HORRIBLE. I have been a faithful skype client for 10 years. I now use facetime because Skype is just a bad product, it freezes, delays sound, cuts out often and drops calls. Old Skype was much better.
Skype	1	2017-12-21T10:09:34Z	"If only I could give a minus star! This has to be the worst ever ""up-grade"" ever. Who came up with the brainwave to take away all the useful 
functionality and instead add childish gimmicks. I'm sure Microsoft had their top team working on this up-grade! Lets stop, take a breath, be brave and go back to the old version .... ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" .... Words fail me."
Skype	4	2017-12-14T09:20:44Z	It is slow and inconvenient in our days when we have such superior chats as Whatsapp and Messenger. Even Snapchat works better.
Skype	4	2017-12-13T07:29:01Z	Skype was one of the most convenient chats, but facebook messenger, whats app and even Viber became better. I am not using it anymore and I give 4 stars only because of some sentiments.
Skype	1	2017-12-11T23:46:11Z	"we have been using skype to conduct business across 46 countries for the last 12 years, it was a very important tool for our company.
The new version is a childish tool that removes the simplicity of use and ergonomics of the tool. It reflects such a lack of respect for clients that we are looking at alternatives, even those we'll have to pay for.
I will gladly pay not to use such crapware."
Skype	1	2017-12-11T13:27:56Z	Skype's latest update is appalling and has no redeeming features ( unless you are 5 years old and like emojis)! Previously useful functions have simply been dispensed with. Sort yourselves out Skype or people will migrate to other services.
Skype	1	2017-12-08T04:02:31Z	"WORST UPDATE EVER........I have used Skype for over 15 years for business communication and overseas voip telephony, but since Microsoft took over they have absolutely killed everything. Why on earth anyone would think it was a good idea to remove all the existing critical functionality and replace it with childish gimmicks like a colourful interface is beyond me. I can't even access the contact list on my mobile phone anymore. Instead have to search for the contact, then copy and paste the phone number over to Skype application to make a call. It's a fricken voip telephone service...what possessed you to unlink the contact list?? Seriously?? No words!! 

I never take the time to write reviews, but I guess I'm really hoping someone at Microsoft is listening. To put it as nicely as possible, you've basically taken a perfectly good, feature rich product and turned it into a colourful featureless piece of rubbish (I wanted to use a much harsher four letter word). Good work!!!"
Skype	1	2017-12-05T19:26:02Z	this is impossible. It used to be a tool for business calls and chats. Now it looks like Facebook chat. Makes me sick. An absolutely horrible update which I was forced to install because the old version refused to run on my Macbook and required an update. Sucks big time.
Skype	1	2017-11-24T03:02:26Z	What BS. I have to click like 50 times to cancel a subscription. Rubbish
Skype	1	2017-11-17T20:25:18Z	"I would give 0 stars if I could. 
I was a Skype user for more than 10 years, until I was locked out of my account, simply because I got a new laptop and my old one was dead, so I couldn't access the account through that.  I had not forgotten my password, but didn't have access to the old email I had used when I originally signed up. I was send through an incredibly cumbersome verification process, asking for information from when I first signed up, as I said more than 10 years ago.  I provided credit card and payment info that  was correct and my security word.  I did this on my own at least 3 times and was denied access every time.  
 I finally chatted with someone from the support team for almost 1.5 hours and it was an absolutely horrible experience and complete waste of my time.  I was asked to do the same thing over and over again to recover my account, even though I explained from the start that I had tried that multiple times.  It never worked and the guy didn't try to find any other way of solving the issue, just saying it can't be done.  I have a balance on the account and he would not even give me a refund.  My money is basically being stolen.  The account recovery process is completely ridiculous, asking for information from more than 10 years ago and security words being ""not enough"". According the to the guy I chatted with, there is no way to send me a recovery link, besides through that process.  It's hard to believe a technology company has no real way to troubleshoot a technical problem.  Skype obviously doesn't care about a customer who had used the service for more than 10 years and paid hundreds of dollars in that period. This is completely unacceptable."
Skype	1	2017-11-17T09:58:11Z	"Accessing my Skype account is a massive problem. Since Microsoft has taken over Skype when I attempt to log in it requires a stack of information about the account which includes credit card details for a monthly invoice from Microsoft in connection with another product and then denies that I have ""proven my identity"" and excludes me from my Skpe account.  Customer unfriendly doesn't begin to describe it."
Skype	1	2017-11-16T11:16:33Z	"Unstable, locked out linux 32 bit customers, web skype always overloaded, delays in message delivery. Not recommended anymore.
""Good Job"", microsoft."
Skype	1	2017-11-10T02:08:57Z	"I do not like the new skype if I could give a negative rating I would!

Where are the tools to share screen, etc."
Skype	1	2017-10-31T17:07:38Z	"Useless now.
I have used Skype for years with no problems for my paid calls. recently it has become a nightmare.
I am unable to access my account with funds in it. I am able to input my Skype username and my password (which takes 2 attempts with the correct password...the first attempt never works). I then get another page which says to enter my MS account. Then says.......

outlook dot ie isn't in our system. Make sure you typed your email address correctly. It usually looks like outlook.dot com

My account IS the .ie. I DO NOT have a .com account.

I was asked a couple of times to do a verification thing to make sure it was, in fact, me, with a whole load (it went on and on) of stupid questions. Some could only be answered if I was logged in!! The stupidity of them (Skype).
Why do they need this if I have my password and my username? Why not just a simple code to my mobile phone?

Their agents are totally inept. They took over my computer 4 times and I had to stop them One guy was where he should not have been...on my desktop and hovering over my folder shortcuts!! He actually clicked on one......can you believe?
I have spent hours and hours with these useless guys and got nowhere.
Yes. I uninstalled maybe 6 times, cleared the cache, etc etc. All to no avail.

Funny thing...the App works fine on my Samsung.

MS has made a right mess out of Skype and I am looking now for another VOIP provider. I don't need Skype anymore.

Good riddence.

AVOID at all costs for paid calls."
Skype	1	2017-10-27T13:20:59Z	"Worst customer service ever. they lose my credit and make no effort what so ever to help.

I hope to never have to use this service again."
Skype	5	2017-10-16T07:43:08Z	"Keep the old version of Skype !

If you are an happy Android device owner, simply remove skype (the new horrible version) and google to find and download an old version  such as the 7.34.0.114 (119886650) appr. 35.69 Mb in size."
Skype	1	2017-10-15T21:40:34Z	"Absolutely HORRIBLE! I can not even find the words to vent my frustration with this ""new"" version of skype. I am furious...can anyone suggest a way to video chat that is not this p.o.s?
F U microsoft."
Skype	5	2017-10-09T19:22:08Z	A good company - only one of messenger sites that seem to work for me these days.
Skype	1	2017-10-06T06:19:43Z	"I called customer support to rectify a situation where I've had two existing subscriptions. A 1 month and a 3 month... these should not even co-exist and I don't know how they both existed. Lag time between canceling, switching or somehow they both were created at the same exact time. I usually get 3-4 e-mail confirmations about the same transaction from my e-mail and phone about the transaction so it's easily dismiss-able to WHICH transaction is being taken place.

I contacted the customer service, not only where they condescending, they make it entirely your fault despite admitting for having a faulty system at that time and stating that it no longer does that now. I have screenshots of the conversation as it won't let me have a transcript, possibly from the terrible customer service they provide.

I asked for a refund and told them that there was a greater issue than just bandaging the current issue at hand. I asked him to cancel all my subscriptions and it became apparently hostile. After I received the cancellation confirmation and told him so, he immediately disconnected, completely unprofessional.

If this individual couldn't handle my case or issue, I should have been sent to someone that could either come to a better resolution instead of hanging up immediately. Absolutely terrible."
Skype	4	2017-09-28T15:24:19Z	I use it at my office because everybody uses it. But it seems often slow, bloated with useless function, and I'm not quite sure they're following a de-cluttering pattern.
Skype	4	2017-09-27T19:20:46Z	Overall, Skype is a good service. I do have slight connection/quality problems from time to time but for a free service I can't really complain. Their screensharing feature is also a great to have as not only does it work well, the quality is also quite clear.
Skype	2	2017-09-26T10:54:19Z	We are using Skype as an office communication tools and it does the job. Unfortunately, it just freezes from time to time and becomes unusable. Also, the update popup is quite annoying.
Skype	1	2017-09-17T02:01:53Z	"Skype is a complete piece of garbage to be avoided at ALLL costs if you value your machines.  

It completely takes over your system, causes system errors, random crashes, NO way to un-install the garbage if you were foolish enough to let it infest your computer, you have to completely rebuild your computer.

This is the second time I tried to give the microsoft junk a chance, NEVER again!!"
Skype	1	2017-09-10T05:50:08Z	The new rewamp of Skype is a complete disaster. Having spent hours trying to use it without getting anywhere, I have now deleted it and using Viber instead. If I could I would give the app less than 0 stars - shame on Microsoft!
Skype	1	2017-09-08T12:38:53Z	My solid old iphone 4s (usable in all respects prior to this upgrade) can no longer use Skype. Skype is a messaging platform and there is no reason why a phone such as this cannot run a simple messaging program. Microsoft have simply decided to make a new app and then restrict access to older versions. Have tried the 'zany' new social media makeover on another Android phone and it makes the application rather horrible to use for a traditional user that simply wants to transfer a message. In addition, the installation of the new app turned my status to online, whereas it has always been set to 'invisible' - I am not impressed.  I have decided to transfer my usage to whatsapp, all my phones, desktops, the lot, my whole family. Surprised and annoyed.
Skype	1	2017-09-08T02:21:34Z	Opened up window to call a number and typed the number in and dialled it and call went ok. Then deleted number in the box to call a new number. Skype called the old number again. Found out that this is some crazy feature Skype added which is not user friendly and annoying. Instead they tell you to 'close the call window and open it again for every call you want to make'. Sorry Skype you just lost a customer out of embarrassment due to calling someone over and over when another number was displayed. Do your developers actually test their product on simple casual users or are they out to make the skype experience as frustrating as possible nowadays?
Skype	1	2017-08-29T12:43:22Z	Worst Service ever, I have been trying to contact skype but no one is responding. Trying to port my number since last 5 five months and its getting rejecting everytime and costing me £15 every time. I would recommend not to use them.
Skype	1	2017-08-27T13:49:16Z	It is by far worst video chat application ever made. I have it installed on two Nexus 7 tablets, Nexus 6P phone and two Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 and S3 tablets.  Also valrious PCs (Win 7 and 10) and Mac. Interface is different on each device.  It is hard to explain to older people (my parrents) every time Skype team makes change to interface and they have no clue where to find contacts anymore but Skype offers them tons of different things that are completely useless for most of the people.  I'm done with that  crap. There are better alternatives.  At least Hangouts looks same on all systems including Windows PCs, Macs, tablets and phones.
Skype	1	2017-08-26T21:49:55Z	"When MSN Messenger was no longer an option, Skype was the best alternative. Since that point, the company really have become far too full of themselves. Bugs are plenty and updates to fix them are few. There are far more issues to condemn Skype than there are to praise it.

Here are some frequent issues:

1. Pending / Undelivered Text 

You can be typing away without issue when suddenly your messages are met with a spinning circle pending connection. At this moment, it's common to check if your internet is experiencing issues or perhaps the fault is with your partner (Whomever you're typing to). Commonly, I will send a message to someone else at this point to discover if the fault is on my end or on the other users end. Most, if not all times, I am met with the same issue, that messages sent to anyone from me are pending. 

I then decide to check my browser and load up websites or videos to ensure I am receiving a connection. The connection is fine, everything else works as intended apart from Skype. This typically lasts anywhere from 1 minute to 5 before the messages will all suddenly send at once.

2. Accidental Calls

If you accidentally hit the keys Ctrl+Q, you have hit the short keys to initiate a call within Skype. 
Typically, this happens when the user has accidentally hit Ctrl rather than Shift. Now, if you call someone and did not mean to, the easiest thing to do is press the cancel call button before the other person answers. However, after having tested this specifically 10 times in a row, both my skype program and the other users skype that receives the call, crashes and stops responding. 

I tested this multiple times and without fail, every single test, it had the same result of both participants skype not responding.

3. Skype on Mobile 

Skype on mobile is simply not a viable option whatsoever. Regardless of how powerful the hardware your phone sports, Skype will inevitably hit a stand-still and is required to be shut down and reloaded. It starts out fine, being able to type at any speed you're capable of. However, as typing goes on, the keyboard begins to lag and suddenly you're having to slow yourself down to pressing individual letters slowly and steadily while the on-screen keyboard has a chance to catch up.

At this point, to prevent it getting worse, you are required to close the app and re-open to refresh. This happens without fail on a regular basis.

Conclusion: 

Skype has many issues that require immediate attention, yet regardless of how many complaints are put online and how many issues are voted highly in the realms of needing fixed, Skype falls silent. We have updates that change the appearance and interface of Skype, giving it a new look and feel, however the same issues from the past persist. If skype wishes to compete with other upcoming services, they really need to begin listening to their user base and not shunning them.

Even the call quality and experience is going down."
Skype	1	2017-08-17T07:30:45Z	Why oh why does some idiot somewhere want to keep messing around with apps and update them for an unsuspecting and I would guess mainly unwanting user base. Microsoft, I am not 15 and I don't want my Skype app to be something a 15-year-old would love to use! Why does your iOS version default to speaker!? Why is it so difficult to navigate? Why does it make the most ridiculous sounds? Go back to how it was.
Skype	1	2017-08-09T15:41:23Z	Only use it because work makes me. Genuinely awful

Skype	3	2017-07-28T13:25:13Z	"This is an edit from an abysmal review I wrote earlier. There are four things I don't like:

1) I am very confused about logging on with username or password. If I log on with username, it seems to be an entirely different account, and nothing works.

2) It is very difficult to find the links for live help. FAQs don't help much. On the other hand, once you're in a chat with tech help, things go pretty smoothly.

3) When you pay for a service, Skype automatically makes it a recurring charge. This is nakedly profit seeking, and should not happen. I'm quite capable of deciding if I want to continue the service or not, thank you.

4) The add credit thing is confusing. I wasn't seeing my subscription show up (see issue #1), so I added credit. I hope I can apply that to my subscription rate over the next couple months. Unfortunately, there are a lot of horror stories online about that, so I guess we'll see."

Skype	1	2017-07-24T17:51:56Z	"My Skype experience as a user has been very clunky, and ever since I used it on Windows 10 I encountered numerous problems. The most common one would be the calls randomly dropping out and video calls sometimes freezing. But the worst part about this is that it keeps pestering you with updates. I've been suckered into updating this software on a regular basis, and I always do it in hope that it may remedy the problems I had earlier, but instead nothing's been fixed. In fact I'd say the updates made it worse. Now my video camera won't even respond. It tells me to close down other programs that may be using it (even if Skype is the only program that's cocking open), and the call dropouts are just as annoying as ever.
There's no reason for all these updates if they can't even fix the most basic of problems. A Shambles."
Skype	1	2017-07-24T04:21:06Z	"Good job microsoft, where do I start with these blatant morons? Microsoft give all the companies back their shares or fund them but have NOTHING to do with the development of them you have constantly proved time and time again you are a piece of crap company i'll give you a comparison.

Before microsoft stuck their crap fingers into skype.
Dropped out rarely
good alternative from msn
worked with long calls

After microsoft.
Constantly and randomly drops call
quality of video and audio that is unstable
Calls bug out of some people for no reason
my skype stops responding randomly
for some reason the responding problem disappears if I use the new horrible windows 10 skype (STOP FORCING PEOPLE INTO YOUR SHI**** UPDATES)
phone skype is 100 time worse with so many options removed and a snapchat ripoff.

If you value any sanity steer clear of skype and use something else until microsoft does us all the favor and leaves.
Why change so much skype? for no reason everything was perfect and then you add all these stupid features to play around with? with no options just this is the new update if you don't update you'll suffer so update and then suffer with our ridiculous changes. . . LOOK AT GOOGLE REVIEWS!!!! on phone devices guys stuff the positive ones look how many negatives are all commenting about skypes recent update."
Skype	1	2017-07-21T08:26:35Z	"I have used Skype for a few years and had no major problem until recently.
The latest update seems to have made a complete mess of what was a good service. It cuts outs out more than ever, its not clear anymore and the other party cannot see me on there screen.

Unless this is sorted ill not be renewing my sub with them because of the above."

What ? Why didn't they advise ??
Today I had a live chat with them and they just said : our refund policy does not allow us to refund you the 36€ or credit. Bye bye.

Skype	1	2017-07-12T01:46:36Z	One of Microsoft's many big mistakes. Yet again trying to catch up with a trend they did not initiate (in this case, youthful social networking) and by doing so, alienating their serious user base (people who just want to call someone on video or phone, not throw emojis or add silly drawings to pics). Incidentally, horrible design and graphics.
Skype	1	2017-07-11T19:20:58Z	"Since Microsoft bought Skypê they have SCREWED it. Customer service is now no longer ""normal"" people somewhere in the Baltic states.

Skype	1	2017-06-16T13:37:42Z	Was great oncee but as mentioned by other reviews around the web, since bought by Microsoft went down rapidly, the amount of adds thrown into anyones bandwith is a noisance, particularly at places where you pay for data volume or with poor internet connection. I wasted my time signing up for their 'Worldwide Unlimited'  calls plan trial. Thanks heavens I went for a trial or I would have wasted my money on a NON-REFUNDABLE worthless plan. I have had it running for 2 days and not a single call completed. Any number gets disconnected as soon it is dialed. Not an internet connection issue, as I can reach the same number immediately after by using another VOIP provider. Worldwide Worthless plan, stay away.
Skype	1	2017-05-31T16:23:41Z	"What happened to Skype during recent times? Did the sane ones die off? It used to be good and in the last year or so it's gone completely downhill.
To summarize: Cut outs in call quality. Absolute ZERO customer service. And worst of all - after an update my mic stopped working properly (both internal and various plug-in devices) and I tried every way to fix it - there is also no way of rolling back and using an older working version of Skype.
To make matters worse. Skype web doesn't even work with Firefox browser.
I can only say that Microsoft's days must be numbered if this is the way they are heading. To call this companies policies and actions of the last year r-tarded would be an insult to r-tards everywhere."
Skype	5	2017-05-31T15:41:20Z	Best service these days. Got fast replies. I adore skype because it helps me see my family when i want :)
Skype	4	2017-05-21T02:30:45Z	I dont get why Skype has many of such negative reviews. The app is still good for talking and I sometimes use it at work and home. Has some issues on connection sometimes but thats quite all drawbacks that I noticed. Everything else is fine.
Skype	1	2017-05-16T10:11:15Z	"No customer support on Skype. I can't access any email or phone support to get back into my account when I'm locked out - the on-screen and email prompts tell me I need to log in before I can access support. How unhelpful is that!
So I can't use the credit I've paid them, and can't find any way to keep using Skype, unless I create a new account, which is a hassle since I have quite a few contacts who know my Skype address.
No good at all. Nil points."
Skype	1	2017-05-13T17:53:28Z	"I bought a new number from SKYPE but it failed to warn me that this new number could not be forwarded to a different number than my existing number is designated to forward to.
There is no way of fixing this or getting my money back for the number I just bought so I feel ripped off completely as I had to open a new account then buy another number for exactly the same price as the one that is of no use to me.
There is no call centre to ask someone whether they could be reasonable about this so I feel angry and frustrated by this multi-billion dollar company ripping me off."
Skype	1	2017-05-03T17:06:35Z	Horrible customer service, no phone number, no options for when you're locked out of your account. Customer service requires you to login to contact them, MY PROBLEM IS THAT I'M LOCKED OUT. Would not repeat.
Skype	5	2017-04-29T14:34:10Z	Amazing for calling on WiFi. I always use Skype to call to my friends when we'd like to game. I've never bought a credit to call someone, guess I'll use my phone, much cheaper and better, in my eyes credits on Skype are useless. Anyway, you should definitelly use it :).
Skype	1	2017-04-17T15:53:11Z	"Skype will take your credits!
If you are inactive for more than 180 days Skype/Microsoft will inactivate the credits on your account. Activating the account again is almost impossible - you have to remember amounts and dates of historic payments, which is impossible after more than 180 days. It is an unacceptable practice. Recommend to only use the free parts of skype."
Skype	4	2017-03-15T15:55:10Z	"Skype was kind enough to take my mone when I purchased a yearly subscription, but they forgot to give me my product. I cannot call via Skype and there is no Skype support line anywhere where I can get hold of a person who could help. 
Very frustrating.

If Skype is reading this please contact me ASAP. 

29/3 update. I have raized the score. I finally got the credit I paid for, and it now seems to work as I wanted it. However I still find it hard to get a real picture over my subscribtions and when they are valid from/to.

Skype	1	2017-03-02T07:26:18Z	"I have used Skype for years. It was a wonderful service and solved so many problems for me.  What is there now is not Skype.  It does not deserve the name. Its disappearing makes me sad.  It was a good thing.

What is there now is some version of a non communication nightmare that has no real customer service but rather endless loops. It is possible that you will be charged for something you do not want to be charged for. It is unlikely you will be able to file the form to get it back. You will want to close your account. You will become bewildered about how to do so. You will  try and try to follow the loop to customer support, be forced to join Microsoft something or other while so doing.  That will not help you. You will be switched back and forth across web and non-web Skype and into microsoft verification forms endlessly. 

I largely feel neutral about Bill Gates and how he has earned his fortune and then gives from it.  I did admire the giving piece.   This fake Skype changed that for me. His affiliation with this product, bewilders me.  It is truly terrible now and feels like it steals from people by how it charges and evades - recourse.  He would do well to discontinue his affiliation with it soon before it really damages his reputation."

Skype	2	2017-02-08T11:53:24Z	"I use skype often for work/personal use and it is a great service. Also was an investor in Microsoft. 

Occasionally I use it to call/text mobile numbers, but not every 180 days and here lies the problem. The credit expires. Isn't that nice for your balance sheet and horrible for the customer? I have to go through an activation hoop, if I have time/notice that my 3.22 cents is expiring within another 180 days. 

You are burdening happy customers with mindless games to save transfer balances from customers to your balance sheet. How about entrusting your product team to create features that people will happily pay for instead of features that finance/senior management want to show shareholders quick wins. 

Devesting in Microsoft. Wrong approach :)"
Skype	3	2017-02-01T00:06:05Z	The quality of service went down a bit. The call sometimes may hang just with no reason - thats the most frequent. But I gathered a huge contact list over these years, so will be using it till the end, maybe the service gets better.

Please activate the money that I added so that I can actually use your service.

4 hours Later and still no credit or response from Skype. Well done skype, you really helped me in my difficult situation. What is the point of you if not for ringing abroad in and emergency? What else would I need credit for? If you don't provide the service, why offer it?"
Skype	1	2017-01-02T14:01:31Z	How can such a simple software be so horrible? And why is it so popular? It is a nightmare to use it.
Skype	1	2016-12-15T06:20:50Z	"When will Microsoft estimate that they earned enough money and that they can start doing thing for the users and not for them to earn more money?

Microsoft bought Skype (by the way I hate the guys that sold that company to Microsoft. you had a pearl and gave it to the devil, shame on you). and since then my Skype is just annoying me more and more day after day. The problem is that I was one of the first users of this program around me nobody used it that I was telling every one about it.. now I just feel a shame to have participated to the extension of this program.

So Skype since Microsoft:
- obligatory update.
-big load on my computer but also modem usage.
- discontinuity of compatibility with the skype mobile I bought for a lot of money.
- discontinuity of service to the fixe phone I also bought a lot and for all family.
- discontinuity of service with Samsung new TV I bought just for that...
- and now the latest, Skype make commercial with sound so suddenly out of the blue in the background of my computer a voice comes and scare the s...t out of me. I thought my grand ma was crazy when she told me that she heard sound coming from her computer... but then I understood. and till now I have found no way to deactivate that except just closing sounds completely for Skype... 

I am sure that you have a longer list and have other issues with skype since Microsoft took it over. for example cut of services all day or weeks in certain country (never seen before Microsoft took over) ...

Anyway, Bill don't you think you have enough money? is it not time to give back to the users without trying to F..k us with backdoors and I don't know what."
Skype	2	2016-12-06T05:49:52Z	The software is terrible, since microsoft took over skype, it just went down hill and laggy software.
Skype	1	2016-11-21T11:30:46Z	"IMO - the whole Skype & S4B platform falls very short of a valid business solution. Microsoft have spent billions developing this product suite for it to be entirely lacklustre.

Even the remote app is a pain to use, it doesnt do some UI niceties such as carriage return when sending an IM. The system is slow and integration with Outlook extremely poor.

As a comparison, the good ole fashion MSN Messenger was a far better and more simplistic package.

If we now compare any of the Skype editions to a modern competitor such as WhatsApp - it's way behind the times with integration, speed and device support.

Come on Microsoft - SORT IT OUT!!!!"

Next thing get 2 debits of £100 on my credit to a Skype account that's not mine.Impossible to contact Skype for reasons above and have to go though the rigmarole of cancelling credit card.Opened another Skype account but would never put money on (gave up trying to get balance on my hacked account ) and would advise all against giving them cc details.

Skype	1	2016-10-19T08:06:39Z	"My old Skype account was compromised and money taken from my account.  Skype ""customer support"" ask you to fill out a verification form.  I filled out this form 3 times and they said each time that I did not fill it out correctly so they can't discuss this any further.  I copied the information directly from the logged in account, so I can only believe that this is deliberate so that they don't have to support you.  Not supporting you means that they can keep your money.  The timing of the hack is especially suspicious as it happened straight after I reactivated some old credit on the account.  I firmly believe that the attitude among their support staff is to deny support.  The biggest worry though is that since they are owned by Microsoft now, any credit cards you have on file with Microsoft Live for other services are SHARED with Skype.  So they will continue to defraud.  I've given them plenty of opportunity to resolve this, even tweeting them.  They even said their supervisor would contact me but nothing.  They have no interest because their whole support system is corrupt."

Skype	2	2016-08-16T11:51:24Z	After the birth of Discord, I have stopped using Skype entirely. Anything Microsoft touches turns to complete BS. Skype is laggy, and slows down your computer. Phone calls often break up, and chat messages takes long periods of time to send at times. I recommend using discord. It's fast and less resource heavy.
Skype	1	2016-07-06T06:50:04Z	"So my Skype account is hacked which is upsetting, worrying and scary.
You want a quick resolution to this to put your mind at rest.
But the Microsoft owned Skype add fuel to the flames of worry but making it almost impossible to contact them.
When you do you need to complete a form so detailed and asking for information that many would never remember that the experience is like Groundhog Day or deja vu all over again.
Not surprisingly this leads nowhere other than repeating the same proces time and time again ergo reference to Groundhog Day.
In complete and utter desperation I wanted to cancel my Skype account which is a hard as quitting LinkedIn who are also now owned by Microsoft.
I actually think that you should be able to buy an anti-Microsoft Virus Software for ALL Microsoft Companies, as once you allow this behemoth onto your PC, Tablet it's harder to get rid of than Japanese knotweed.
The irony of this situation, given its VOIP, is that it's impossible to call them which would make life easier and remove the on-going stress Skype causes in these situations.
In such a litigious age maybe if someone took legal action against them for the resultant stress they cause it might set a precedent for others!
Truly awful experience and 8 months still unresolved."

It took so many phone calls And emails to ""Skype"" to cancel my payments. I must have wore out the buttons on my phone.
I spoke to so many different operators on the phone. (It nearly drove me ""Mad"" & I shed a few tears with frustration.)

Skype	2	2016-04-01T18:24:44Z	Skype is great for use, but if you want to delete your account, it is the worst kind of way out!!! The site is not updated, because they mention an email adress for contact so they can delete your profile, but it is almost impossible to find it! All in all, if you create a skype profile, be sure that you want to keep it, because it is a hell of a puzzle to delete it.

It took us over 24 hours to contact customer service. The phone number to the Netherlands is wrong.
Finally, I received a link to live chat. (15th November 2015)

The customer service rep blamed me for everything. 
He used poor English and it was difficult to understand him.
I was emphatic that I did not order this product. 
I suggested that it was a scam.
He suggested that I change my password which I already did when I received the first email.
Obviously, I would know if I ordered the product.
I do not want this product so why would I order it?

I found this suggestion unacceptable, belittling and rude.
I am very disappointed with Skype.
This is a warning to other customers. Watch your credit balance carefully for hidden deductions and products that you have not chosen."
Skype	1	2015-07-11T11:05:36Z	"I have once visited Korea and used my usual Skype account from there. Interestingly, according to Skype, I'm now forever based in Korea and my account is linked to some weird Korean provider making it difficult to perform the simplest transaction. Skype's customer service, unhelpful and arrogant to say the least, was trying to convince me that I set up my account with their Korean partner. It didn't matter that my account was set up years ago before they even entered into the partnership. The individual I was speaking with, didn't even bother to check these details, instead I was requested to verify my address by sending them a bank statement/ bill (?!?!) Once document received, the process on their end would take min 24-48 hours. Of course, she was deaf to me saying that I urgently need to purchase the service, I'm not based in Korea, I don't even speak Korean and I only holidayed there for 4 days! She also did not care explaining why Skype members are not being warned that using Skype from selected countries can link their accounts to some dodgy Skype substitutes. 
This is my 2nd run in with Skype's shocking customer service in 4 weeks, both were equally ridiculous and frustrating. Skype used to be my favourite service, but it has hit rock bottom, time for a replacement."
Skype	2	2015-06-13T13:30:08Z	If you need Skype for any sort of chat/voice/video that deos NOT include using a regular mobile or landline telephone connection Skype is competative - However if you need to use it in order to purchase a telephone number is any of a wide variety of countries - avoid it like a plague because the prices are truly outrageous ($6 a month compared to $0-$1 a month by average of the sites that I examined - and if you want a refund  - keep on dreaming!
Skype	1	2015-05-20T11:36:07Z	"DO NOT TOP UP YOUR SKYPE ACCOUNT!!!
It is probably rated TOP SECRET and above by Microsoft... how many accounts have been locked due to their software failure and later the inability to say the simple word ""Sorry""... what is even worse is that third party attempting to infiltrate your account to prevent sending your messages as in cases with human rights violation... leads automatically to lock down of the account. In a way that means that the government can shut down now practically all your accounts GMAIL, SKYPE, YAHOO, FACEBOOK by just attempting to sign in... to recover your account is unfortunately not that simple. Basically if you give SKYPE all the information it ask from you, you shouldn't wonder if your bank account is infiltrated thereafter:

SKYPE and Microsoft are aware of it and yet willingly or unwillingly they are supporting criminals and militant regimes with their inability to see pass their rules of secrecy...
Considering the absolute disinterest from Microsoft to provide adequate service and take customer seriously... there is only one conclusion possible. The independent SKYPE was too much of annoyance for corporate America... as long SKYPE existed no one would have made money. Considering the amount Microsoft paid for SKYPE and the disinterest now it is more than a conspiracy theory. The new way of doing business... buy it, run it down and dispose of it. If Microsoft was the alone buyer or it was a joint venture we will of course never know. 

What we have here is a war between corporate America and the independent world of the free users. Most of us are using Facebook and despite the poor quality still hanging to the ruins of SKYPE without giving it a thought... no wonder with generation of papa Simpson coming into being we have never been in graver danger to go under the wheels of the corporate and government whimsicalities.
Stop using SKYPE or you are putting your life and the life of other people in danger.

Very poor stability, awful user experience, application unstable most of the time, Inability to answer calls, multiple interfaces kicking up on incoming calls, issues when multiple sound devices connected and the list goes on. Shameful for a company like MS who has huge brain, technology and financial resources."
Skype	1	2015-03-22T10:51:10Z	I sent a number of Skype sms text to my girlfriend's mobile and she received none of the messages, although I have £10 of credit.  After making the messages I was charged for them (the Skype credit has deductions made for the messages) and it says that they were delivered but she did not receive them.  When I use my regular Tesco mobile to contact her she receives the message.  I think Skype free services are excellent but their sms to a foreign mobile (UK to Austria) are a waste of money.  I only lost £10.  I suppose they collect revenue for their free services this way :-)  Last £10 you'll get from me.
Skype	1	2015-01-22T17:40:17Z	"I have had been using Skype for a few years as a free user, I starting working away from home so I subscribed to a Skype service with a recurring payment. Everything seemed great, then one day I received an email stated my email address had changed, then shortly after I received two emails from PayPal referring to two successful payments to Skype (this was all at the beginning of Oct 2013). I had not changed my email or made the payment so I tried to contact Skype, unfortunately Skype don't have a helpline number, they do have web chat but you need to log in, and at this time my password had also been changed by the person that had taken over my account. So I had to complete an online form, I received a reference and a note stating someone would contact me within 24hours. At this point someone was taking money from my account and Skype wanted me to wait, I contacted PayPal who stated that the payment was automatic so couldn't be stopped, so I phoned my bank, they stopped all payment to PayPal and the payment in process. So the next day I received an email from Skype stating that something with my request was incorrect and I was to follow a link to complete an online form, I selected the link which took me to the same page as I completed the day before, so I completed the form and also emailed Skype contactus address, again the message stated I would receive and email within 24 hours and again the same email back, to complete the online form. I replied to the emails but with no response, this went on until later November. So as I was getting nowhere I started to get fed up, so I tried the forgot password link after a few weeks of trying to change my password, I received a new one. So I could now access my account, when I logged into the account I noticed I was in credit for the two payment, so I tried the web chat to solve the problem but the guy told me to follow a link or try the contactus email, the link was for the online that I completed at the start, but I tried the form again but was still doing something wrong so nobody would help me, so I asked the online chat to help but again the same link. This went on for a bit, then in about March 2014 I received an email stating my account had been taken over so was block to protect me (5 months after I reported it), I tried to resolve the issue but got fed up, so stopped using Skype. It is now January 2015 and received an email stating my balance is due to expiry, this is to an account that is blocked.

I am not saying don't use Skype because the free service is good but what ever you do don't use any paid service because your money isn't safe. When I had my problems I also posted it on the Skype online community, to my surprise I found that I wasn't alone and many people had lost money, some in the hundreds but Skype aren't interested."

After much time, many emails with requests and very bad reviews online, I finally managed to get my discount, so I change this review from 1 to 3 stars.
Background: 
I was purchasing an item online, and it had a 20% discount on it. First of all, it took very long for Skype online shop to process my order. Second, they ""forgot"" about the discount. Then, when I contacted customer support, they assured me they would take care of it. Nothing happened. I asked and asked, they said they would deal with it. Month and a half - and nothing has happened!
Furthermore, as I live in Denmark with very high customs fees, I only wanted to buy something shipped out of Europe to avoid customs fees. This product was shipped out of Hong Kong, which they mentioned nothing about online. I contacted customer support also about this, and the same thing happened: They said they would deal with it, ""rest assured"" and other meaningless words, and nothing has ever happened. Finally, the product is not the quality that was described online at all! The price for that product was way too high for its value. Be careful."

Skype	1	2013-11-10T14:54:13Z	"In the past three months I have lost just under $100 from spammers on Skype. 

My account was used as a spammer's delivery tool in Sweden. Over one-thousand SMS texts were sent from my account - half in September and half early November. 

In September, a hacker gained access to my account and began to spam people in Sweden with texts. I promptly went to Skype customer service - attempted to resolve the issue, be refunded and move on. We took all the necessary steps to recover my account and make sure that nobody gained access to it again. Customer service agreed to refund me for the ""Auto-recharge"" cycles that occurred 5 times during the hacker's shenanigans and cost me $14 each time.

Since then I have cancelled auto-recharge.

However, I have still not been refunded.

If that isn't enough - in the past few days THE EXACT SAME THING has happened to me. 

I followed the same steps, talked to Skype customer service.. did all of the security measures to ensure that it didn't happen again. I explained to them that even though my ""auto-recharge"" was turned off - it WAS STILL HAPPENING. They promptly continued on with the same security measures that did not protect me the first time... or the second time. 

Upon me asking for a refund due to their inability to secure my account, the customer service rep then told me that it's not their responsibility. 

Allow me to make that clear to anyone willing to give Skype their personal information and/or money - IT IS NOT SKYPES' RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP YOUR ACCOUNT SECURED.

After spending 1.5hrs on the live chat with a customer service rep dodging my requests for a refund, he told me that they needed to ""convert this communication to email so we could further investigate the said issue"". On my approval of this ""conversion"" the chat was ended by the rep.

Skype	1	2013-04-26T21:46:35Z	skype sucks big time crap why did msn force us to switch to this crappy thing with such crappy servie trying to charge us for somting we once had for free this is all just B.S GIVE US BACK OUR PLAIN OLD MSN MESANGER. NOT IMPRESSED WITH SKYPE WHAT SO EVER IT IS HARD TO USE
Skype	1	2013-04-08T08:31:59Z	It is really painful to add credits for international calling.
Skype	1	2013-04-02T22:15:59Z	Skype has been a horrible experience so far, it doesn't replace MSN at all. While MSN provides comfortable chatting with friends with more free customizations, Skype is only convenient for video call. It doesn't take into consideration user's other needs as a messenger. I want to make my chatting window smaller so i can chat and watch vid at the same time, Skype screen smallest size still takes over half the screen. I want to customize my text into different color depending on who i chat with, I can't. I want to change background of my chat room I can't. Skype is so fucking boring, the only reasonable feature it provides is video call. It doesn't cater to none call related users who simply want a light IM messenger free of charge.
Skype	3	2013-03-26T12:38:42Z	"Have been speaking to Skype support for weeks about unfair charges, with no result what so ever. When I call a land-line sometimes Skype starts charging even if nobody picked up, I can hear the ring tone but Skype is charging and I end up paying for connection and for the first minute even though nobody picked up.

Also Skype rounds the charge into their favor. I call to a country and the charges are following: Connection fee 7.6p and a minute is 6.9 total 14.5p, but Skype charges 15p, they round this into their favor.

I am not paying to Skype any more, will be using only their free services and for paying services will go to other provider.

I would not recommend using Skype paid for services, it is a RIP OFF"
Skype	1	2013-03-13T23:42:26Z	"I have always been a keen MSN user and have had no troube using the MSN video chat feature.  The latest update of MSN indicates a ""merge"" with Skype, forcing me to have a Skype account (oh goodie!).  So I tried my brand spanking new Skype system to have a much needed catch up with my long distance boyfriend.  Skype was VEEERRRYYYY slow.  Infact I had to cease all other activities in order for it to open properly.  Then came the much awaited video call...... or an attempt at it.  I saw more ""slow connection"" ""connection error"" messages than I did of my partners face.  The connection was the worst I have ever experienced.  I decided to close down the amazing new Skype and recall via the MSN messenger - which suprisingly had no trouble what so ever delivering a successful video call.  My mysterious connection problems seemed to disappear, so the problem is with Skype.  Not a great first experience really.  It was like using dial up!"
Skype	4	2013-03-11T21:28:43Z	More ADs, unstable mobile app updates, etc...
Skype	1	2013-02-09T14:52:03Z	"Lets sum it all up in 5 dot points:

- It messes with my Google Chrome, and it is a pain to fix.
- There are major issues in transferring contacts from facebook, and even searching for solutions on the internet, I never found out the problem.
- Customer service can do with a lot more work.
- Freezes my laptop, even when it's the only thing running
- All-In-All, Skype is a waste of time, and is a pain to use.

I wanna give it half or no stars, but I can't do that. So the lowest I can go is ""ONE"" star."
Skype	4	2013-02-05T02:39:39Z	Skype is a great way to keep in touch with friends and family but there are several bugs that make the system not-so user friendly and difficult to maintain a connection. I consistently have to disconnect and reestablish a connection however, when it works, it's a great service!
Skype	2	2013-01-12T18:36:26Z	"So, the new software that 'improved' the Skype experience is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.  I could not use it and had to go steal the old program off of my husband's hard drive, erase the new version and re-install since I was not able to download an old version of the software anywhere online that I saw.  The old Skype interface for Mac is A+. I love it.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I'm using version 2.0.8.866. 

The customer service at Skype is 100% INEXCUSABLY AWFUL HORRIBLE TERRIBLE.  I can't be any  more clear than this.  If you have a problem with your account or your software, pucker up and kiss your patience goodbye.  You will NOT be able to locate useful information on their website.  You will NOT be able to reach a customer service rep that will help you or be useful other than them doing a GREAT job of taking 18  minutes to answer one question incorrectly.  

I know that it's not on purpose that things are this way, but Jesus.  I've been on chat for 27 minutes now and nobody can answer the question ""why can't I renew my skype number for 12 months instead of only 3"".  I can't believe that it's taking this long.  These people are totally incompetent."
Skype	2	2013-01-06T20:50:04Z	The latest version of skype is configured in such a way that it is no longer clear where to find your Contacts list; in fact, I have spent the last hour looking and am still unable to call skype-to-skype to any of my contacts.  According to one of the support threads, I'm not the only one who has experienced this problem. I'm very disappointed by skype and hope they can solve this problem.
Skype	1	2013-01-05T01:21:48Z	Skype has added malware to its software that takes control of your computer and prevents it from accessing Google and Gmail and takes over your browsers to require that you use Babylon, a malware search engine.  Skype downloaded Babylon, Bloson, Price Beep and Password Box, as well as several other malware programs, all for the sake of their making a few cents off these malicious programs.  Skype's anti-service and anti-user practices are reprehensible and deserving of stern condemnation.  It took a half day to remove the malicious programs Skype caused my computer to be infected with.  I caution anyone considering using Skype to use great caution when downloading the service.
Skype	1	2012-12-24T08:40:37Z	Wanted to ordered a Skype gift voucher from Skype official site and was redirected to ChatAndVision. After one day they delivered the voucher by email, but it never worked (even tried multiple times and with different accounts). Contected support. Responded after 2+ days. No use. Avoid.
Skype	1	2012-11-29T22:03:59Z	I spent 20 minutes with Skype's overly complex, many-page sign in process, and even bought $10 worth of credit to begin calling, only to find out they want $30 a year just to have a number to call from. If they're going to charge that, they need to post it up front, on their very first page, not hide it after you have wasted time and money signing up for their ripoff service.
Skype	5	2012-11-14T23:49:58Z	I moved away from my family from TX to HI and have been using Skype video calls to keep in contact and let my 2 year old nephew get to know me. I can only make a trip out to TX once a year so having him know my face is a really big deal for me. I also use Skype to talk to my boss and co-workers when working on projects. It helps me co-ordinate and get my questions answered faster than email would.
Skype	5	2012-10-30T21:35:51Z	"I use Skype for both personal and business needs.  I especially love the fact that I can screen-share while working with a trainee or one of my fellow contractors.  The video chat comes in handy when the kiddos want to chat with relatives that aren't local....and sometimes even the local ones!

I really don't have anything negative to say.  I suppose I would like a ""mark as un-read"" option for some of my work dialogue, but that's not too big of a deal."
Skype	4	2012-10-23T03:12:12Z	We live in a world where people are so far apart. Friends from high school and college and family members are spread all over the country. Skype gave me the ability to not only talk to them, but also see them through video chat. I have been able to see my nieces and nephews grow up even thought I'm not near them Instead of meeting every Christmas, I get to see my family every week. The same goes for my friends from school that live in other states and even other countries. Skype has let me keep in touch with the people that I love.
Skype	5	2012-10-18T14:09:13Z	This thing makes life much easier. It gives me an opportunity to take interviews, have conversations with friends and collegues not just on my pc, but on the go as well. Love it!
Skype	5	2012-09-27T17:51:06Z	Great way to communicate with a great value.
Skype	4	2012-09-18T03:05:23Z	This is one of the greatest things ever.I love talking to my sister who lives in NY face to face.I feel like we still live together and have not missed anything.It is amazing seeing her everyday
Skype	5	2012-09-11T16:59:25Z	"I am personally online very much of the day. Instead of owning a smartphone i just use skype, i have made a little list why i love skype.

1. It's free. And i mean completly free, no ""2 hours a week-rule""
2. It's easy, fast and reliable.
3. Amazing sound quality. It will go as far as your microphone will.
4. Webcam? Share your screen? They got it all."
Skype	5	2012-08-31T19:33:32Z	Good service and low prices
Skype	1	2012-08-24T15:08:26Z	"I have been a skype user since there were just 30,000 users on the system. A long time. I have enjoyed many good years and hundreds of hours with friends and relatives all over the world.
On the strength of this I created a Business account, added my credit card details, added work colleagues, never really benefitted from group screen sharing because it never worked and it turned out to be an expensive console to add or remove members.
I have tried to cancel the subscription on my credit card, but it has not been possible because it tells me I should transfer credits to a user before I can do this. There is no way to do this because the web page for months has given me a system error. Today I received another subscription payment notification with my credit card statement...just to add further insult to injury! It's not even possible to delete an account. What's that all about? Even Facebook deletes photos now!
Skype customer services hides behind pages of inter-linked information that goes around in circles of Q&A pages and when I have been able to find a mail address to write to I don't get an answer.
Very disappointing. Now I use Viber."
Skype	4	2012-08-20T12:02:32Z	"The service is great - super useful. However, the software needs a lot of work.
The settings are difficult to use and are not organised logically.
The default sounds Skype ships with are horrible.

Screen sharing now costs money? I understand that they need to make money - but I feel like I may need to look for a new alternative."
Skype	5	2012-08-02T17:19:23Z	I use it for all my long distance calls and it is a fantastic tool to keep phone bills under control.
Skype	5	2012-07-26T17:28:53Z	I use Skype most of the time and my phone bills are ridiculously low. Fantastic, low-priced service.
Skype	5	2012-07-25T16:51:26Z	Easy to use and the best way to keep in touch with family and friends overseas.
Skype	5	2012-07-24T20:32:09Z	I use Skype on my phone very frequently. Definitely very useful way of communication and very convenient.
Skype	5	2012-07-24T19:31:43Z	I am using it often and it has saved considerable amount of money to me.
Skype	5	2012-07-23T16:11:27Z	I am using Skype regularly for all my long distance calls. It is incredibly convenient and cheap, I highly recommend it.
Skype	4	2012-07-21T16:35:45Z	Skype is an excellent way to communicate with people who live abroad, without spending too much on expensive land lines.
Skype	5	2012-07-18T02:31:19Z	Thanks to Skype I can now see my grand daughters from across the country! This is great because getting most young kids on the phone for longer than a minute is hard. Give them video of themselves and me to star at and make funny faces helps keep their attention. Great product especially for free!
Skype	5	2012-07-17T22:55:00Z	Does not required speed internet, more than enough WiFi connection and mobile internet
Skype	5	2012-07-16T18:37:56Z	I am in love with Skype I can chat for hours on end with people around the globe.  Its absolutely fabulous! Even though if you want to make a call you have to pay how cares its cheap and easy to do.  Some people would prefer not paying so you can still chat if you have a webcam you can make a video call.
Skype	5	2012-07-16T08:50:36Z	best video chat software. really  like the simplicity of the messenger and great quality video communication.
Skype	5	2012-07-14T10:17:02Z	So far nothing beats SKYPE.
Skype	5	2012-07-13T18:11:27Z	This is for my wife,as she uses it a lot.
Skype	5	2012-07-13T00:13:33Z	Great service
Skype	5	2012-07-12T08:30:15Z	skype team is from one mother,,,, they are efficient and always ready to assist. i am always glad to use skype servives, they act immediately when technology does not measure up and always make sure you have a good experience on skype. bravo bravo skype
Skype	5	2012-07-11T17:46:51Z	My grand children don't live close enough to me so Skype is my answer to having tea parties on screen with grand kids and there dolls/bears and who ever else is invited including bringing in other family on same chat, it is so brilliant as a family we have all sat chatting, watching the kids at play whilst drinking tea/coffee.  I can think of nothing better apart from living next door to my family.
Skype	4	2012-07-11T10:01:29Z	"It's easy, but it's a pity that internetconnection is not available in certain area's. So: Skyping in not possible. 
It happened also once that a message that was send to me, was delivered 3 days later."
Skype	5	2012-07-10T18:49:05Z	I have tried almost all applications to create albums for the Web. Compared with JAlbum some are easier to use but it is profitable to devote two or three sessions to learn JAlbum thoroughly, then he discovers powerful options and practical features not found in more expensive commercial programs. I am very satisfied with the purchase although I have not experienced the sale of pictures and videos through PayPal, one of the distinctive possibilities of JAlbum. Very good!
Skype	5	2012-07-10T04:46:06Z	This is the best site that has proven extra-ordinary from it's counterparts. Glad to see that Facebook has the integration of Skype. So far, I never had any issues in using this product. Even downloading it from it's native site was no big deal. Am still a regular user of this product and I wholeheartedly recommend this product to all, because all the services including the customer service, is carried out so nicely by the corporate.
Skype	2	2012-07-09T21:48:25Z	The phrase 'At least we're not paying for this' is often used in my Skype conversations, which is definitely true. If I had to pay for a shoddy video and distorted sound I would be royally pissed off. Thankfully I don't. But the reason I use Skype, apart from it being free, is that I am travelling. I must state that one reason for my terrible phone conversations could have something to do with the hostel's wi-fi connection, but half the time such an excuse is not valid. But it does the job (except when the call unexpectedly drops) and hey, at least I'm not paying for it.
Skype	5	2012-07-09T06:03:25Z	Thanks SKYPE to reduce my telephone bills. I can not only talk to my love once but can see them too... Thank you
Skype	5	2012-07-08T12:48:42Z	great for video linking all over the world to chat in video
Skype	4	2012-07-08T01:56:46Z	Traveling abroad was always a challenge when it came time to phone home....now I am only a Skype call away.  Also great for family video calls and conversations with on line gaming.
Skype	5	2012-07-07T23:02:52Z	Very easy to use and lag free
Skype	5	2012-07-06T11:44:51Z	"There is nothing better so far for VOIP that I know of!

It's clear (almost CD quality with the right mics) and nearly always faultless.
The webcam, group call and IM features are great also!

Not to mention it's available on nearly all smart phone platforms for free WiFi calls abroad :)

Keep up the good work guys!"
Skype	4	2012-07-06T11:38:46Z	Is just my PC or does skype seem to make everything else go slow!
Skype	1	2012-07-06T06:10:14Z	i can't buy any credit using my paypal account
Skype	5	2012-07-03T18:51:54Z	This just makes it so easy to call over seas and it is very affordable
Skype	3	2012-07-03T15:21:31Z	"well skype could deffo be better,the quality is not always the best and sync is sometimes out,on the other hand it is the cheapest way to contact your friends around the world and it is free to call skype to skype which is excellent! 

good program to download if you have family to far away and you just want to chat!"
Skype	4	2012-07-03T11:48:31Z	I use Skype on my iPad and have found really useful when I'm travelling and with more and more businesses using it, it's become an accepted means of communicating in business.  There have been one or two glitches for me with SMS messaging where messages have been delayed by a number of days, but no evidence of a delay at my end.  But this is an isolated incident.  Overall, it's invaluable.
Skype	4	2012-07-03T08:42:08Z	"what a great way to keep ion contact with my family and friends back home.
sometimes its a bit laggy but ther then that its great!"
Skype	5	2012-07-02T20:57:22Z	what's more it's free
Skype	1	2012-07-01T20:50:18Z	I have 100mb internet, my internet is phenomenal. Skype, however, isn't. For once i'd like a conversation with no lag, no jittery video and no out of synch audio,
Skype	2	2012-07-01T18:06:24Z	half the time it doesn't work or it crashes but i do like it.
Skype	4	2012-06-30T13:48:31Z	Great to be able to talk and see your family and friends that live far away from you xxx
Skype	5	2012-06-29T01:34:38Z	Its greatest value is in it that it saves you insane amounts of money for long distance calls.
Skype	5	2012-06-28T20:31:30Z	nothing much said MS screwed it
Skype	5	2012-06-28T15:06:43Z	I use this to call Australia weekly, and it doesn't cost much at all compared to land line
Skype	4	2012-06-28T01:15:12Z	had a long distance relationship going for a few months, we communicated on skype through facebook.  it was pretty reliable and great to realize that technology let my man meow to my cats from 1200 miles away
Skype	5	2012-06-27T17:35:11Z	clear cut picture with solid connection. easy to use. a few clicks and your away chatting
Skype	2	2012-06-25T16:39:58Z	"Takes up too much on the computer and takes ages to load. It rather gets in the way. I don't use it often but when I do it proves its worth.

It is also irritating that this is yet another programme that lets in Spam,"
Skype	5	2012-06-24T20:25:57Z	I live quite far away from my family so Skype is great for keeping in touch! It's great to let the family see how the little one is growing up too, until we can visit next. And it's free - what more do you want?!
Skype	4	2012-06-23T16:59:57Z	Skype would have got 5 stars, but the video likes to freeze up and calls get dropped, but what can u do when it's free and ur talking to people in different counties. I <3 skype and can't thank them enough it made his 12 month deployment easier on both of us. We skyped everyday several times per day!!!!! THX SKYPE!!!!!!!!!!!
Skype	5	2012-06-20T00:26:12Z	I love Skype it is a great affordable was to communicate. I talk over the phone with my husband everyday and only pay 2.99 a month!
Skype	4	2012-06-18T23:43:21Z	"Skype is excellent.  It enables me to be in contact with family in Australia, Canada and other parts of the world.
Keep up the good work!!!"
Skype	4	2012-06-18T20:07:07Z	I Skype with my son in California (I live in England) and it's great when it works, but sometimes we have problems.  Mostly, though, it's amazing to see my son and his family every week and we really enjoy our time on Skype.
Skype	2	2012-06-17T20:26:06Z	"I like Skype - and it works well enough.  However, the idea that my credits expired over time (a few years ago) is something I cannot tolerate.  We give money to them in advance - which means they have our money for a time without having to provide a service, then they tell us that we have to use them within a certain time period of they will confiscate the credits.  This is very poorly thought out approach since it alienates the customer for good.  It is like insult added to injury.

If this policy were not in place, I would still be a spending customer with Skype.  The net profit for Skype with me would have been in the positive.  I'm afraid that this is a poor decision made by management that will cost Skype in the end."
Skype	3	2012-06-15T18:13:07Z	keeps crashing my computer & made it run slower also skype keeps crashing mid way through a hat, but has its uses when it works its could ,
Skype	5	2012-06-15T16:06:33Z	I'm always using skype services when I want to make long distance call with relatives. The quality of sound and image are very good.
Skype	5	2012-06-14T21:17:04Z	Me & my partner communicate using Skype all the time, either through the laptops or iPhones because we are currently living in different countries and in a long distance relationship. It is a great, free way to stay in touch and it makes it slightly easier been so far away from each other for long periods of time! I know dont know what we would do without Skype!
Skype	4	2012-06-12T13:43:37Z	i love skype but i think that not enough people use it! they should promote it more and make it less confusing to use like the paying for calls and tryng to find contacts.
Skype	5	2012-06-11T16:29:48Z	speech quality has improved.
Skype	5	2012-06-07T10:26:54Z	You are truly genius to enable us to talk to family and friends, all over the world, for free! Thank you soo much.
Skype	5	2012-06-06T01:45:21Z	The best thing about Skype is that you don't have to pay to use it. You can do video chats or just use it as a messenger  very helpful tool.
Skype	4	2012-06-04T03:57:50Z	I really do like skype. It's made connection to people in other areas, and countries so much easier. And it's FREE! What more can you want? PLUS, you get to see the other people. They're a little problems, such a connection and clarity, but that's minor when you consider all the good factors.
Skype	2	2012-06-03T22:24:01Z	... need I say more?
Skype	5	2012-06-02T22:40:57Z	I find that Skype is one of the most innovative apps to come out. It really is nice to connect to family and friends and be able to do it face to face. Love it.
Skype	4	2012-05-31T16:21:09Z	EASY TO USE THAT MEETS OUR NEEDS
Skype	5	2012-05-31T14:40:23Z	"When I am traveling around the world and need to call to airlines, credit card companies, financial companies, or businesses back in the US I use SKYPE to make those calls free.  I even use them at home instead of my cell phone for those long waits for 1-800 service.  

Also, calls home are very cheap and easy to make from a good wifi connection with my iPad compared to using an international phone card from public phones.   I don't use the video feature very much, just the audio and most calls come through better than my ATT cell phone unless the wifi is really boggy."
Skype	2	2012-05-30T15:17:35Z	Living in Spain I thought it would be the best way to stay in touch with family and friends in the UK but quite often we lose contact so many times that we give up.  It is seldom possible to be able to see each other and I have been really disappointed.
Skype	5	2012-05-29T17:18:14Z	My cool website ...I love Skype!
Skype	5	2012-05-26T07:56:18Z	The best connection and sound.
Skype	5	2012-05-25T13:29:47Z	love skype.com  can talk to my familys that live away and see them and show each orther thing  we feel so near..
Skype	4	2012-05-24T05:35:34Z	Wife and i love to use it on deployments but not always reliable.
Skype	5	2012-05-20T09:35:21Z	Just the very best - all family and friends can be seen online - superb
Skype	5	2012-05-19T15:43:36Z	I use Skype on a regular basis to chat with gaming friends, the quality of the calls are top notch hardly any call drops
Skype	5	2012-05-15T11:35:09Z	I love SKYPE.  As long as you have the right internet tariff you can't go wrong.
Skype	5	2012-05-15T06:46:00Z	At This Moment There are plenty of Video & Audio calling/contact but yet I depend on Skype. They have given me a lot of comfort. Thanks Skype.
Skype	5	2012-05-14T10:51:57Z	I use Skype everyday to keep in touch with friends around the world. Great service.
Skype	5	2012-05-14T10:44:52Z	cheap way to communicate
Skype	5	2012-05-14T06:49:57Z	Skype is my and all my family favorite to talk to chat and to share video.This make my family one unit.Voice and video quality is second to none.I love this software.You also get Skype to change your world of interaction.
Skype	4	2012-05-14T06:39:52Z	its on of the best software for onlie chatting and video chatting.
Skype	5	2012-05-11T07:22:51Z	I use it as my primary communication system.
Skype	4	2012-05-10T18:01:35Z	as i just recently registered, and got to speak and see my family across the other side of the world, its really good
Skype	4	2012-05-10T04:15:29Z	As a free product, excellent, tho info is a bit hidden and no easy 'contact us'.
Skype	5	2012-05-08T22:12:39Z	"I love Skype! Since I live abroad from my family and have friends all over the world it saved me so much money!!!

10 out of 5 stars!"
Skype	2	2012-05-08T19:50:52Z	The free service was weak and always dropped my calls. I did pay for one month at the cheapest package. It was a slight bit better but not much approved. My internet connection was fine i even tried another service and it worked a lot better. Dont pay them for this service.
Skype	5	2012-05-08T12:18:02Z	My son uses skype for online learning from a Tutor in Pakistan and it works great, we havent had any issues with this and if people can use it as a business tool then thats great.
Skype	5	2012-05-04T18:58:29Z	Great to be able to speak to and see all my family from the comfort of my armchair.
Skype	4	2012-05-03T07:12:53Z	Its easy to use, its effective and best of all its FREE.
Skype	5	2012-04-28T14:27:12Z	stable chatting
Skype	5	2012-04-28T13:13:34Z	Impossible to live without anymore)
Skype	5	2012-04-27T07:58:38Z	The flexibility of Skype is brilliant.  When we travel we can call family and friends with and with out computers, with and without access to wifi and with and without cameras.  Furthermore, the quality of sound and pictures just keeps on getting better and when you ring telephones the cost is negligible.
Skype	5	2012-04-27T05:35:19Z	"I can't say enough for what this technology and product has done to staying in touch with family & friends across the globe.
You guys are FABulous and second to none !! ... I thank GOD for such a medium of communication !!!"
Skype	5	2012-04-25T16:46:04Z	"it is very nice to speak with my family in australia
i am very happy with it"
Skype	3	2012-04-25T10:10:13Z	"I use Skype mainly for intercontinental calls. Whilst there are indoubted cost benefits the quality of the ""line"" (audio over IP) is often very poor with interference and or dropping of sound.

If you want to save money - great!
If you expect comparable quality to a phoneline - you might be disappointed!"
Skype	5	2012-04-22T08:53:20Z	I get one refund with them very easily. easy communication.
Skype	5	2012-04-21T18:49:23Z	Skype crosses oceans, time zones and the restraints of expensive call charges. You can talk to someone on the opposite side of the globe face to face whenever you want at no cost.
Skype	1	2012-04-18T21:03:05Z	Never been able to get my head aroiund this one. Leaving well alone.
Skype	5	2012-04-17T16:36:12Z	I love the way if I want to chat with my mum or other friends and family I can: face to face.  I use Skype and it's just the best.  My mum can see the children and what they are up to... the only down side is she can also see when I need to do the housework.
Skype	4	2012-04-17T14:58:36Z	It is really useful when travelling, but some things can be improved. It will be interesting if the option of opening files to share in the communication was added to the software. Anyway, for calls, I totally recommend it
Skype	5	2012-04-17T12:51:46Z	Its funny to have contact whith freinds who dont live next to you
Skype	2	2012-04-17T12:36:50Z	"I loved Skype, easy to use and keeps costs down.

Then when I needed some assistance (they over billed me) it took an age to solve."
Skype	4	2012-04-12T13:33:14Z	"I use skype very regularly, first to chat with my girlfriend abroad, and since I moved to her, to contact my family. 
No complaintes, although at certain moments in time the line could be more crisp."
Skype	5	2012-04-12T13:02:15Z	i love skype specially video calls
Skype	5	2012-04-11T23:04:41Z	No probs, works great, if both parties enjoy a fast connection to the web.
Skype	5	2012-04-11T15:56:16Z	"If you want to ""Reach out and Touch someone"" Skype away!"
Skype	5	2012-04-10T13:03:24Z	yahoooo Free video calls awesome...!
Skype	4	2012-04-09T09:16:38Z	I looooooove this service!!!! I used to just instant message and text message my girlfriend and friends but now I can see them through this service. You never know who you are talking to until you see them personally and this allows you to do just that
Skype	5	2012-04-09T01:06:43Z	Skype: easy to use and it allows you to video chat with others no matter how far away they are.
Skype	5	2012-04-08T21:14:20Z	I always use Skype on my PC and my iPhone, since I can carry video call with friends and family, using 3G/4G, not just WiFi.
Skype	5	2012-04-05T20:31:20Z	My parents are hearing impaired & it is awesome for talking to my parents since we cant talk like most families.Awesome for talking to family that live abroad.
Skype	5	2012-04-01T10:19:14Z	Boy  - I even SMS calendar schedules to myself with it - It is like a phone, a fax, a PDA and a chat system all at my fingertips...
Skype	5	2012-03-29T11:12:55Z	Make video and phone calls to family and friends all over the world.  One of the best inventions on the planet!
Skype	1	2012-03-28T17:38:08Z	I really liked the skype until my account was hacked by someone in Russia. Luckily, I caught it before they racked up too much, under $100, but despite all of my efforts I could not get in touch with any type of customer service from skype. I just wanted to make sure this would never happen again, but they obvsiouly had no interest in helping their customers, even when they are the victim. I will never use skype again for this reason. I cannot trust a company that will allow my information to be hacked and then provide no customer service to console me.
Skype	3	2012-03-28T13:37:30Z	Most used phone company. Calls to Cuba are very expensive. Please lower your rates to Cuba and offer monthly rates. Customer service is simply unacceptable. I was overcharged for several calls, asked to adjust, received no reply.
Skype	5	2012-03-26T21:46:38Z	My daughter lives in another state and I am unable to fly there to see my first (and probably) only grand child in real life.   Skype is amazing!  The picture is SO clear and usually the voice is as if we are right beside each other as we visit.    I can see the baby stretch and smile and sleep while my daughter and I talk to each other.   Life is GREAT!  Skype is GREAT!
Skype	5	2012-03-26T13:02:38Z	perfect way of keeping in touch with my friends living down under... with an added bonus of video calling it's like being there in person - without the sun of course :-(
Skype	4	2012-03-25T16:26:05Z	sometimes I use it
Skype	2	2012-03-25T14:00:04Z	Rely on Skype but is hapless and hopelessly useless at the MO!
Skype	4	2012-03-25T10:11:04Z	What a great way to contact family and friends when tou are away from home
Skype	4	2012-03-24T20:12:29Z	Your windows version should never be better than your linux version.
Skype	4	2012-03-24T11:42:02Z	It's nice and all but take back the 'plugins' and remove the add. Also fix the weird looking interface. Thanks!
Skype	5	2012-03-23T17:57:53Z	"Skype is very efficient to share files and talk online. I use it daily and I love it! Their program looks very nice and has many features. Their calling prices to landlines and stuff like that are cheap.
It's too epic to describe!"
Skype	5	2012-03-22T15:19:13Z	While spending a year in Europe, Skype made it so that my family was never too far. Either the paid service or the free service is worth doing. (Maybe cancel your expensive long distance plan and get the phone app too!)
Skype	4	2012-03-22T12:17:38Z	I love that I can talk with my mum who is in another country on my iPhone for free! Thank you Skype, you're doing amazing job.
Skype	5	2012-03-21T17:15:19Z	"I live thousands of miles from my family in Malaysia so Skype is like my connection to my family. It's great to be able to speak with them and to see them on Skype especially when I miss home so I appreciate Skype very much. Without it, the world would be a lonely place. 

Thank you Skype."
Skype	4	2012-03-21T16:34:00Z	Apart from the moments when the connection goes dead, particarly when I use my online phone number, Skype is great. We use it on a day to day basis to show each other what we see on our screens and to work together with people all across the continent.
Skype	5	2012-03-21T14:37:47Z	On an  extended trip abroad and having elderly relatives (none computer owners) I need to keep in touch with I checked out various ways of making cheap telephone calls. I have found Skype by far the most convenient, easiest and cheapest way of doing this. So easy to add more credit and very low prices.
Skype	5	2012-03-21T11:32:12Z	Thank you Skype for keeping our family in touch through good times and bad.  It's wonderful to see eachother and to show thinks as well as tell.  My cats met their Australian furry cousins on screen!  Our first grandchild thinks we live inside the computer!  Thanks for making it all possible.
Skype	5	2012-03-21T11:11:15Z	I am a huge fan of Skype! I get to see family and frinds abroad for free at the cilck of a button!!! Amazing!
Skype	5	2012-03-16T17:42:23Z	I Chose Skype because I can communicate with distant relatives
Skype	5	2012-03-15T13:17:16Z	Skype is amazing. The fact that I can talk, for free, to people all over the world, is something to behold! I worry about a day when this will start to cost.
Skype	1	2012-03-14T11:32:38Z	"The sound quality is quite bad, impossible to use with iPhone without WiFi.
Would not recommend to use paid services."
Skype	3	2012-03-13T19:35:46Z	its good to for video chat but seem to be finding problem these days quite often... would be great if we could do group video chat.. but extra cost just turns off..
Skype	5	2012-03-13T14:50:42Z	brings the otherside of the world into your living room
Skype	4	2012-03-11T06:13:26Z	I wish that the quality of video chat would be better, but other than that, I love that I can keep in contact with my sister when she's all the way on the other side of the country.
Skype	5	2012-03-07T14:20:25Z	What a peice of software! - Great for keeping in touch with friends & family.
Skype	5	2012-03-07T09:31:47Z	"We use Skype's free video conversation link to speak with friends in Europe. Aside from slow connection issues, service provider not Skype related , we have found the experience rewarding & is an excellent way to keep in touch with those you care for.
we haven't used the other Skype tools so can only comment as above.
Recommended highly."
Skype	5	2012-03-07T07:57:20Z	Excellent tool
Skype	2	2012-03-06T00:53:27Z	I tried this company when they first came out and even with local calls the audio was low and callers couldn't hear me, even with headset, etc.
Skype	5	2012-03-04T19:54:51Z	When our daughter moved away to Australia with her husband we were so sad to see them both go, and even sadder to see our three grandchildren leave with them. The telephone of course is far too expensive, but SKYPE.COM gave us the perfect means of seeing our family grow up. I really can't say enough just how happy I am to have been shown this lovely lovely site.
Skype	5	2012-03-04T07:22:28Z	I use it every day because of its quick and perfect text and voice communication with friends, allowing to send files and links with the text. I like to see, if a friend is online now. You also can help friends by viewing on their desktop about Skype. This Screen Sharing feature (only in the newer Skype versions since version 4.1) is a similar function as the professional tool TeamViewer offers for this purpose.
Skype	5	2012-03-03T19:54:53Z	Talk, chat and videocall with friends from all over the world, stay in touch with loved ones and people you care about..for free!
Skype	1	2012-03-03T13:35:41Z	such a long delay on phone calls, drives me insane, wud rather pay!!
Skype	4	2012-02-27T18:18:14Z	"Not sure Iif my mums loves skype even more than me, hehe, since I have an account  I call home more often and in the last year I even can see my family with the webcam...It definitely improved communications internationally. and is so cheap! or even free!
However it sometimes have signal problems or echo"
Skype	5	2012-02-26T17:01:43Z	One son in University another in Perth Western Australia, there is no better way of keeping in touch. AND IT'S FREE
Skype	4	2012-02-25T22:07:09Z	really cool application.
Skype	5	2012-02-23T13:41:06Z	Very professional!!!!
Skype	5	2012-02-23T10:04:45Z	' I Am Very Satisfied''
Skype	5	2012-02-23T01:10:44Z	I love Skype!  It's so neat to be able to talk to friends and family face to face.
Skype	5	2012-02-21T22:04:26Z	"Great Company! I recommended them to my Son.
I bought an ionizer from life ionizers about 3 years ago. I liked the fact that they customized my filtration system and the water has done wonders for my health. At 62 years of age I appreciate things that optimize my health and well being. I called up to get new filters and they told me how to maintain my machine, which was great. The good deal was that 3 years after I bought my machine they sent me a free one year membership in their alkaline lifestyle health community. Great information on having a healthier lifestyle!"
Skype	5	2012-02-21T06:31:23Z	I can see my grandchildren on the other side of the world grow up
Skype	4	2012-02-19T17:19:27Z	Wonderful VOIP service for international calls.  But MMS way too slow and uses too much band width for good video calls.
Skype	5	2012-02-19T16:56:53Z	i've been with Skype since it first started; they have shrunk the world - and for free! Please may that never change.
Skype	5	2012-02-19T06:24:18Z	I swear by Skype especially if we are talking about long distance love affair. This site helped my son maintained his 10 years long distance relationship with his girlfriend who happened to be living in the U.S. He didn't have a  US Visa so he couldn't visit her. Everyday since skype came into the picture, he get to see her and talk to her. Last December, they finally tied the knot. Both are now in the US. THANK YOu Skype!
Skype	5	2012-02-19T03:12:53Z	Skype gives me the ability to speak with my friends in other countries without spending 900$'s for the phonecall - it allows you to maintain your connection without charging you an arm and a leg.
Skype	4	2012-02-19T01:24:25Z	it is so great to be able to keep in touch with family and friends when you are apart.... for free is even better!!
Skype	5	2012-02-17T23:38:25Z	no real complains...sometimes some echo, but im ok with it.
Skype	4	2012-02-17T18:59:44Z	skype lets us communicate with our daughter its excellent
Skype	4	2012-02-17T13:53:53Z	i've had less sucess with voice when trying to use it with a couple of parties inthe UK and one in India
Skype	5	2012-02-17T12:38:37Z	Skype on the iPad 2 is a most excellent product. It even works via 3G saving me on more than one occasion when I needed to make a phone call, but had forgotten my mobile phone! Brilliant!
Skype	5	2012-02-16T17:36:13Z	I use Skype for all the call I make to Cuba.  I have excellent sound and little delay if any.  The time I buy is actual unlike many calling cards.  I recommend Skype for calling Cuba.
Skype	5	2012-02-16T08:13:15Z	Best Service & easy to operate. Slowly- all my family and friends are now using it. Cannot survive without it;
Skype	5	2012-02-15T18:19:56Z	having never used skype before was highly impressed with its ease of use,and the clarity & quality of the phone calls
Skype	3	2012-02-15T14:21:34Z	I use Skype a fair bit, it's ok i guess but get a fair few problems, and there is much better programs out there such as teamspeak which is my favourite
Skype	3	2012-02-14T12:29:49Z	Skype, although I don use it much, is a great tool to maintain communication with distant people, business, friendship or pleasure. But in order to maintain that communication in desirable level, they need to improve it, because the laggines ruins it on video calls, even if you have great cam and internet speed. Other than that it does what it says most of the time.
Skype	5	2012-02-13T16:17:08Z	"great opportunity to speak to anyone in the world for free
great"
Skype	3	2012-02-12T03:45:22Z	"Most incoming calls never ring on the iPhone 4S, don't even notify but go straight to voicemail.

Competing products like Viber work like a charm for both incoming and outgoing calls."
Skype	5	2012-02-11T10:21:32Z	I love Skype. I've started using it for business as well now with one of the online numbers and it's saved me a lot of money.
Skype	5	2012-02-10T04:49:19Z	excellent service and fast delivery
Skype	3	2012-02-09T23:50:59Z	The layout of the latest version of Skype is so wasteful of screen space it's almost impossible to use on a laptop.
Skype	5	2012-02-09T11:28:46Z	skype lets me see my family abroad
Skype	5	2012-02-09T08:53:27Z	Skype is awesome, I use skype to make calls around the world with cheaper price to pay.
Skype	5	2012-02-08T21:39:17Z	Easy to download, install and set-up. Great for chatting to family and friends abroad or in other parts of the country.  All you need is a web cam and a mike.  Couldn't be easier!
Skype	4	2012-02-08T19:49:28Z	"Works really well for face to face calls. iPhone FaceTime is probably better quality image but no good if the other person doesn't have an Apple product like iPhone or iPad!

Fantastic when you're in another continent since you can load up credit and call to a land line back home at much lower rates.  You can even set it up so that your own phone number appears when you call that person back home."
Skype	5	2012-02-08T19:28:08Z	The best service for cheap calls.
Skype	5	2012-02-08T12:30:12Z	Skype is very helpful service anywhere, at home, at hotel, in airport. If you can't live without contacts with your friends, parents or children s, this program for you. This is cheap, fast and secure. Forgot about mobile phone if you have Internet and Skype. I use Skype around 10 years and don't found best service in the world.
Skype	5	2012-02-08T05:35:05Z	Skype is very useful. I rated it perfect!
Skype	4	2012-02-07T23:27:35Z	It's great to get calls for free
Skype	5	2012-02-06T17:07:08Z	My son and daughter-in-law live in Japan, and we regularly communicate via Skype. I can't express in words how nice it is to be able to SEE them both while we talk. It takes the thousands of miles away!!!
Skype	5	2012-02-06T14:04:52Z	a********************
Skype	5	2012-02-05T21:40:44Z	You can call anyone anywhere who also has Skype for free.. Their prices for calls don't blow me away but they're OK. Overall can't really complain. Never had any major issues. Half decent mobile app.. Does suffer with some crashes though (iOS).
Skype	5	2012-02-05T15:38:43Z	Skype has changed by life in so many ways, it's a great service and is very cheap. I have a world subscription and I can make calls to telephones in most countries of the world for free.. I could never have dreamed of this just a few years ago.   Thank you skype, you changed the world for me.
Skype	5	2012-02-04T17:21:19Z	It helps us so much when we are abroad then we can communicate every day on phone calls.
Skype	2	2012-02-04T02:11:47Z	Updated version of skype of freezes the computer and the application is too slow.
Skype	5	2012-02-03T20:40:53Z	It's a great site, where you can find whatever you need, contact the seller, solve problems . I've hused it more than 200 times... it's a pitty that the sites of ecommerce  developed locally here can´t achieve even a half of the quality of ebay...
Skype	3	2012-02-02T19:54:21Z	Skype is still the best option for overseas calling however they continue to struggle with consistent audio and video feeds. You would think by now they would have figured it out.
Skype	5	2012-02-02T06:31:07Z	great way to keep in touch with friends
Skype	4	2012-02-01T03:39:03Z	Would be perfect if they built a good web application (to bypass my company firewall that doesn't let me install new software).
Skype	5	2012-01-31T14:19:08Z	We used to phone the USA and had a deal with BT. But our friends said get on Skype, I was talked through it and found it easy to set up. YOU DO NOT NEED A CAMERA as someone in the computer magazines insisted you did. We already had a mic and speakers. So set up was easy. I have told others about the site and the options they give you, including the option to FREE calls to the states via the internet. Most modern laptops already are set up for Skype, so there's no need to buy extra items. We saw the snow from their house as moving the laptop around you can broadcast to others. Skype gives you eyes on the world.
Skype	4	2012-01-30T19:13:21Z	I love using it to talk to people that are far away, but as soon as I reach around an hour of talking to someone, it always seems to drop the call.
Skype	4	2012-01-29T18:33:53Z	Great service love it
Skype	5	2012-01-28T19:49:44Z	The best thing since sliced bread----and its free.Every body should download and try it.Great for keeping in touch with family and friends. I chat to my son in Tenerife (and see him) every night and like I say its free.
Skype	4	2012-01-28T18:55:23Z	Everything is great, video and calling is great, however, the quality of the video and sound is questionable, but great value for money none the less
Skype	3	2012-01-27T22:18:01Z	Skype is very useful.  often times the calls drop.  But im happy skype app is available for smart phones.  He international rates are still not so competitive.  Hope your company can do something about the international call rates.
Skype	5	2012-01-26T22:46:52Z	connects me with friends and relatives
Skype	5	2012-01-26T04:57:42Z	Great way to stay in touch with friends and family all over the world!!
Skype	3	2012-01-25T21:08:21Z	I would love to be able to juggle between my work and personal contacts, like appears offline for one list and online for another while using thevsamevaccount.
Skype	5	2012-01-24T22:26:56Z	Great Job Skype. You bring families and friends together when no other way is possible.
Skype	5	2012-01-24T19:20:07Z	Easy and comfortable to use
Skype	4	2012-01-24T15:03:19Z	I really do enjoy using Skype, only I seem to regularly have problems with my webcam...
Skype	3	2012-01-23T23:46:35Z	I like the service but it never seems to be very clear for me when I use video...
Skype	5	2012-01-23T11:14:20Z	"The best video call site so far. 
I use skype every day to chat to my friend in America, I watch her getting her breakfast ready before she leaves for work, whilst I am thinking what to have for lunch as there is a five hour time difference between us, I love Skype, wouldn't be without it."
Skype	2	2012-01-22T13:10:19Z	Do I cheaper with Microsoft Live! I web-conference with my family in Australia every week for nothing more than the cost of my broadband
Skype	5	2012-01-21T22:18:47Z	Fantastic Idea Quick Easy & Cheap If You Call Anybody on Their Mobile Abroad
Skype	5	2012-01-21T05:54:20Z	Skype is great to see the good and bad of places out in the community.  Look at reviews before trying new places out.  THANKS for Skype
Skype	5	2012-01-20T04:40:59Z	We were able to show all the family in various parts of the country the brand new baby in Honolulu.
Skype	2	2012-01-19T12:22:48Z	When calling on landline. The other line always hears an echo. I use headphones and I hear everything fine, but for the one I´m calling it´s very annoying.
Skype	5	2012-01-18T10:31:37Z	Thank you skype! Use subscription too,never had any worries about the payment or the service.
Skype	5	2012-01-17T20:56:20Z	Not much to say.. Skype works and its free..!
Skype	4	2012-01-16T11:26:42Z	I really like skype - to be able to see people miles away and talk to them - fantastic. It is a pity that the video doesn't always work as well as it could - and the sound sync is a bit weird. Nonetheless, the benefits outweigh iffy quality.
Skype	5	2012-01-15T16:15:51Z	Saves a lot of money on phone calls.  Seems to work really well 95% of the time.Would recommend to anyone
Skype	5	2012-01-14T23:44:02Z	Skype is one of the few ways I can stay in touch with all my family and friends while I am in Afghanistan. For that, I love it.
Skype	5	2012-01-14T17:58:28Z	"We enjoy being able to visit and see our son, daughter-in-law and two youngest grandsons.  We live so far apart and do not get together very often.  So, seeing them is especially important.  Since it is free, it is even better.  
Thanks Skype for all the hours of enjoyment you have given us."
Skype	5	2012-01-14T12:27:32Z	good chat program and reliable
Skype	4	2012-01-13T01:42:12Z	"Affordable phone on your computer.
Where else can you make a local call from half a world away?
Just remember a USB phone style handset to eliminate the bugaboos of having a speaker transition to a microphone to a speaker.

The only drawback was when we had to sign-off and say farewell."
Skype	5	2012-01-10T19:59:04Z	I enjoy using Skype, but it sometimes feels like it isn't integrated into my computer system well enough. It often feels like an outskirt of a program. However, it does provide easy free video calls or video and provides cheap calls from computer to mobile.
Skype	5	2012-01-10T13:47:48Z	"Since moving overseas, Skype has been the key to staying in touch with family and friends stateside.  I love that I can use it as a substitute for text messaging (huge savings there!), on my phone like it's a normal phone call, or on the computer to see everyone ""in person.""  Such a lifesaver!"
Skype	5	2012-01-10T11:41:05Z	being in various countries in a month i can't survive without skype's voip service.!
Skype	4	2012-01-08T21:42:07Z	I am very satisfied with the service. Now I can talk to the dear people and friends around the world, very convenient - for free. Super.
Skype	4	2012-01-08T17:03:26Z	...now and again there are connection issues, but I think Skype is a wonderful service and has revolutionized my ability to function personally and professionally as I live and work overseas.
Skype	2	2012-01-06T18:46:01Z	"I found this company good for video to video chat. However when I tried to use Skype credit to make international calls I unfortunately discovered how expensive they are! Also the quality is terrible! 

Needless to say, good for free video but bad for international communication"
Skype	5	2012-01-05T20:58:04Z	I use Skype as my main means of communications as I do not have a landline,I am extremely happy with the services and the charges.Thanks-Skype Team,Keep Up the great work!
Skype	5	2012-01-03T16:07:01Z	"WithTraveling overseas the best and lest cost effective way is to use SKYPE to phone each other and family.  I have spent hundreds of pounds/Dollars over the years.  But it would have been thousands if it were not for SKYPE.

We have bad connections sometimes but that due the location and counties I’m staying in.
We can see each other besides talking.  Thank You SKYPE and keep up the good work

Skype	3	2011-12-30T23:06:42Z	I long for the days when Skype had a simple user interface. Now it's trying to be another Facebook. It's a phone book dammit!
Skype	4	2011-12-28T20:59:10Z	"Skype is great. Being in Mexico and having Skype allows me to keep in contact with my friends in Canada and the US.
So glad they are around."
Skype	5	2011-12-24T16:39:30Z	I only use the basic Skype but it is good to know about the innovative possibilities. The audio quality has improved greatly over the years and it is good to know that the company is continually working to improve.
Skype	5	2011-12-23T09:32:02Z	You can contact your love one as often as you want and as long as you have time.  Great and Thank Skype to offer this convenience communication channel.

Skype	5	2011-12-18T00:39:48Z	Use it to keep in contact with loved ones. Hope it stays free!
Skype	3	2011-12-17T18:36:59Z	"As a long time user and paid subscriber to Skype, I have been somewhat annoyed with their customer service. On a few occasions recently I have tried to use the feedback or compliants form and almost in all cases it crashed. 

My biggest gripw is that it is no longer the cheapest service (by some margin) and there are several others that are stepping into the arena. I will be trying them soon."
Skype	4	2011-12-16T23:55:22Z	Had problems topping up, but service is very good and great cheap way to speak to friends
Skype	3	2011-12-16T03:46:13Z	If the product works, why try and change it and piss people off from using it. Just leave it alone.
Skype	5	2011-12-12T07:32:19Z	love this service to speak to my overseas family and can meet all my nieces and nephews
Skype	5	2011-12-10T15:57:21Z	Great price and service, especially if you have Fios.

Skype	5	2011-11-26T20:24:49Z	exelent service
Skype	3	2011-11-26T20:21:55Z	I used to marvel at skypes stability and dependability. Now, each time it updates it becomes even less stable.
Skype	1	2011-11-22T14:36:12Z	"My account was hacked, Skype allowed £50 of my money to be taken from my credit card, and then they just said they wouldn't refund any of it.
They seem happy to profit from crime."
Skype	4	2011-11-22T10:48:12Z	Skype does everything it says it will do but not always smoothly.
Skype	4	2011-11-21T11:52:25Z	Its amazing that we can speak to people across the globe for no or very minimal cost. Love it personally as it helps keeps in touch effectively.
Skype	4	2011-11-20T20:01:38Z	Have used Skype with Family and friends in the USA, Japan, Oz and other parts of the uk. Brilliant way of staying in touch.
Skype	4	2011-11-19T02:33:10Z	They need to upgrade the MAC version. I feel the PC version has better programing. Ex. on a PC you can snap pics of the people you chat with while on the MAC version u dont even have that option
Skype	3	2011-11-18T20:56:18Z	there is better message systems than this.. writing works fine
Skype	5	2011-11-18T03:07:51Z	From calling home from Overseas to VOIP with gaming friends Skype has carved out a spot in everyday life.

Skype	5	2011-11-15T10:02:55Z	SKYP IS REALLY EASY TO USE AND GREAT FOR ALL COMMUNICATIONS INCLUDING CALLS TEXTS AND IM'S I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE
Skype	5	2011-11-15T05:40:56Z	"I first discovered Skype about 4 years ago and signed up when line rental cost more than my phonecalls! Skype has allowed me to see my family from the other side of the world, show them round my new house, introduce the ""grandchild"" - our Malamute and take part in a Christmas Eve tradition I would have otherwise missed.
The services offered, the quality of the connections and the fact that mostly it's free is awesome!
Thanks for getting us together Skype - nice one!"

Skype	5	2011-11-07T17:27:16Z	Been using Skype for a couple of months and have been much more impressed than I expected to be
Skype	3	2011-11-07T16:54:15Z	I don't know what it is with this service but since Microsoft took over it has been consistently on the decline. i have more dropped calls than ever before and sometimes the service just doesn't connect. i use skype for business calls and it makes me look bad when i keep dropping clients and associates in mid call.
Skype	4	2011-11-01T22:10:14Z	Only problem is working iout the time zones in which my colleagues function.
Skype	5	2011-11-01T07:26:31Z	the best one
Skype	3	2011-10-31T13:08:07Z	hopefully thing will improve with MS onboard!
Skype	5	2011-10-30T00:19:56Z	I use this site very regularly to talk t my friends at home. I have been travelling for 9 months and this service has saved me from missing my family and friends too much. I love that I can see them while we talk.
Skype	4	2011-10-29T09:37:41Z	Usually I need to call twice to get a good connection - that's a pity
Skype	4	2011-10-27T16:58:50Z	Apart from the odd distortions I am happy using Skype and haven't come across any other service that offers the amount of variety that Skype does.
Skype	3	2011-10-23T22:19:31Z	Not so easy to setup, and to use...
Skype	5	2011-10-21T13:08:35Z	excellent site to talk around with family and friends
Skype	2	2011-10-17T16:25:03Z	"Skype used to be fantastic now that Microdoft have bought it they keep changing and altering it, adding things taking other things out.

It constantly spins at the side not delivering your messages, VIdeo is terrible quality now.

Skype	5	2011-10-04T16:50:30Z	best site ever
Skype	4	2011-09-24T10:28:02Z	I use skype mainly as im a mother who sits in at night rather bored and tired, so i log on and chat to my friend who is also at home with a kiddie and its a lovely way to chat face to face and not feel so alone. Only problem is background noise is awful at times, signal goes in and out but apart from that great
Skype	5	2011-09-23T15:52:02Z	Could not communicate without Skype!
Skype	5	2011-09-22T23:36:31Z	Best invention ever. No more paying £££s for calls abroad... I don't even know why people still use phones and calling cards to call abroad, I swear it's cheaper to just get internet access and a PC for whomever you're calling and just hooking up on Skype!
Skype	4	2011-09-16T17:56:19Z	I can't believe that i haven't used this for years. Not only is it free when you speak to others on it, but better still i can talk to my computer and keep both hands free!
Skype	5	2011-09-15T11:39:58Z	Super skype - my best tool - never take it away it is a great piece of technology - 5 stars

Skype	4	2011-08-02T06:23:22Z	convenient and always works.. though their rates aren't the best.
Skype	5	2011-07-13T13:54:50Z	If you have relatives abroad and you both own a pc then you should really consider using skype as you can call and talk for hours for free. Why pay for costly phone calls when you don't need to. Easy to download and set up and easy to use.
Skype	5	2011-06-05T00:47:48Z	"This software is the best around for instant messenging with video and voice capability - fast and reliable for file sharing and the best is it's free for the basic service which works just as well as if you pay - there are lots of service available within skype once you join

Skype	1	2021-01-10T16:58:00+00:00	Disgusting. Skype effectively operated as a scam. Took my money, then won't reconise my microphone. The microphone is in perfect working order. It has worked without problems with endless apps and websites, and I've checked and it still works fine with other apps!
Skype	3	2020-12-28T11:57:59+00:00	"Outdated.

It's easy to connect and find contacts, you can see who is online, you have a record of how long your calls last, you can voice or video call, you cant send images and chat while on the call.
The only issue I have come across is while screen sharing, Skype starts to massively lag and often cannot keep up. It cannot take the weight of this feature, unlike Zoom for example which is much faster in that regard. However I find it the easiest to use out of all and the most transparent."
Skype	1	2020-12-07T02:54:32+00:00	Very bad customer service. I have no idea how a big company like this can have a hard time replying to its customers???!!! I don't appreciate big companies that are not willing to invest more into customer service.
Skype	1	2020-12-06T16:25:38+00:00	I hate using Skype--much prefer Zoom--but I have to in order to communicate with a certain group of folks.  The reason I hate Skype is that it's technical support for me is totally meaningless.  No, that's not right, it's worse than meaningless, it's misleading.
Skype	5	2020-12-06T13:25:43+00:00	I like the new update of Skype! I am using Skype for my online teaching, and it is very convenient and easy to navigate. So far this is the best platform in terms of the sound quality especially in piano teaching. I am using Skype years ago and the quality is still up to par.
Skype	4	2020-12-01T21:40:13+00:00	Used it only for a few months but did not have any issue. Also their customer service was very quick to resolve my refund request.
Skype	1	2020-12-01T08:01:51+00:00	Customer support is always unavailable. In the meantime I receive automated emails stating that they are going to charge me a monthly fee for something I don't even have a subscription to.
Skype	5	2020-11-30T15:59:09+00:00	Excellent App, it just needs to be faster
Skype	1	2020-11-29T11:48:59+00:00	"The design of Skype is very bad. 
There are boxes, all over the screen, you close one and another opens, sometimes there are two boxes.
There is an emoji that flashes, not sure why, as there are only 8 available, this is very annoying, we use this for business, we don't need a heart emoji flashing during a sales call.
How can Microsoft, not design Skype to be simple and efficient, like Zoom?
Why does it need to be so badly designed?"
Skype	1	2020-11-27T16:13:40+00:00	Purchased a subscription from Skype but the number didn't work.  Tried to get through to CS, but it was impossible.  In the end, I cancelled my subscription.  Stick with the free service.

Skype	1	2020-10-28T10:23:20+00:00	Awful interface.Settings either in wrong places or completely hidden. Grid views never work properly. Caller windows don't appear. People can't see each other. No clear idea why certain video windows don't appear on main screen as grid - or at all - but may still indicate as 'connected' via circular profile icons at top. It's a complete mess.
Skype	1	2020-10-25T15:11:14+00:00	"Signed up as I am sick of being charged ludicrous charges for landline calls. Complete waste of time as recipients don't receive calls from Skype....looked online and suggested adding a caller ID, finally found that and it wouldn't accept either my landline or mobile number as ID....should have guessed M$ would have put the kiss of death on Skype, just look at Windows 10 - a total joke

UPDATE
As I couldn't get it to accept my mobile number and could find no way to contact them, other than automated M$ BS I opened a Paypal dispute and they instantly refunded my money....good riddance, wish I could be refunded for totally useless, waste of everybody's time, Windows 10 too but I didn't buy it as I had it forced onto me when they ended support for Windows 7. Which always worked just fine, usual in denial M$ always thinking they are right but just seriously haven't got a clue"
Skype	1	2020-10-17T05:27:35+00:00	Skype live captions are abysmal!  The text is unreal, and absolutely NOT what’s being spoken!  Nonsensical.  Absolute rubbish.  Why have this app if it just does not work!  Best just remove it.  Totally rubbish. Extremely disappointed as I was hoping to be able to use this app.
Skype	1	2020-10-16T05:59:25+00:00	"cant leave 0 stars. Or negative stars. But If I could I would leave negative stars.  Or a very dark, dark black 1 star. Please do not add up the 1 star ratings from all your unsatisfied customers, you cannot count up the 1 stars to make more stars.  Bad Microsoft.

Unresolved issue about billing after 5 contacts with skype customer support over a month with different but equally unhelpful advice provided at each encounter, acknowledged to be a skype side error rather than a banking error because ""there was a limit on the account are being set automatically by the system/you already reached the purchase limit"".  Please note that even attempting the lowest refill of 3.87USD as suggested by the last manager could not be processed. (brackets: ""I'm sorry sir, your deposit services have been suspended, you have deposited 19USD into our bank over the last month and the system can no longer allow you to deposit 3.87USD: compu'a says no, please try again in a month"".).   Customer support, my suggestion would be change profession to another company: have you tried Viber?

I understand this is a chat forum for microsoft Skype, so I should ask a question to open dialogue: can anyone suggest a better system of VOIP or has anyone tried Viber? 

So just to confirm: my account was created over a month ago (around 9 august), had ~20USD added to the accoun which was used over the last month, and you cannot add USD3.87 credit to the account because ""because the system is not allowing you to purchase since you already reached the purchase limit"". Please confirm this as yes or no.

Skype	3	2021-01-12T17:06:39+00:00	It shows my credit in Danish Corona but I live in Finland. I don´t see how to change currency.
Skype	1	2021-01-10T16:58:00+00:00	Disgusting. Skype effectively operated as a scam. Took my money, then won't reconise my microphone. The microphone is in perfect working order. It has worked without problems with endless apps and websites, and I've checked and it still works fine with other apps!
Skype	3	2020-12-28T11:57:59+00:00	"Outdated.

 Simply an outdated platform, it is still a decent one but it is simply old. Most people migrated to other platforms, it is not like skype is bad just... who you gonna talk to there is no one uses it any longer?"
Skype	1	2020-12-27T14:29:41+00:00	"When Skype came out I thought it was a great app but since Microsoft got its claws into it, it got worse and worse.
The interface is terrible. For instance, when you are in call mode or on the contact screen there is no option to return to the main screen where the profile is.
You can't edit a phone number that has been copied and pasted because when you press on the number, it is completely erased and many more inconsistencies that I'm too pissed off to continue writing"
Skype	5	2020-12-20T21:05:07+00:00	My favorite app for business calls.
Skype	4	2020-12-18T21:49:13+00:00	"I use Skype everyday for work, and I must admit I have found it the best out of all the video-conference platforms. 
It's easy to connect and find contacts, you can see who is online, you have a record of how long your calls last, you can voice or video call, you cant send images and chat while on the call.
The only issue I have come across is while screen sharing, Skype starts to massively lag and often cannot keep up. It cannot take the weight of this feature, unlike Zoom for example which is much faster in that regard. However I find it the easiest to use out of all and the most transparent."
Skype	1	2020-12-07T02:54:32+00:00	Very bad customer service. I have no idea how a big company like this can have a hard time replying to its customers???!!! I don't appreciate big companies that are not willing to invest more into customer service.
Skype	1	2020-12-06T16:25:38+00:00	I hate using Skype--much prefer Zoom--but I have to in order to communicate with a certain group of folks.  The reason I hate Skype is that it's technical support for me is totally meaningless.  No, that's not right, it's worse than meaningless, it's misleading.
Skype	5	2020-12-06T13:25:43+00:00	I like the new update of Skype! I am using Skype for my online teaching, and it is very convenient and easy to navigate. So far this is the best platform in terms of the sound quality especially in piano teaching. I am using Skype years ago and the quality is still up to par.
Skype	4	2020-12-01T21:40:13+00:00	Used it only for a few months but did not have any issue. Also their customer service was very quick to resolve my refund request.
Skype	1	2020-12-01T08:01:51+00:00	Customer support is always unavailable. In the meantime I receive automated emails stating that they are going to charge me a monthly fee for something I don't even have a subscription to.
Skype	5	2020-11-30T15:59:09+00:00	Excellent App, it just needs to be faster
Skype	1	2020-11-29T11:48:59+00:00	"The design of Skype is very bad. 
There are boxes, all over the screen, you close one and another opens, sometimes there are two boxes.
There is an emoji that flashes, not sure why, as there are only 8 available, this is very annoying, we use this for business, we don't need a heart emoji flashing during a sales call.
How can Microsoft, not design Skype to be simple and efficient, like Zoom?
Why does it need to be so badly designed?"
Skype	1	2020-11-27T16:13:40+00:00	Purchased a subscription from Skype but the number didn't work.  Tried to get through to CS, but it was impossible.  In the end, I cancelled my subscription.  Stick with the free service.
Skype	4	2020-11-18T12:25:48+00:00	The app itself is very good, but the service can be much better
Skype	1	2020-11-17T11:18:00+00:00	so tired of receiving the microsoft text message to verify my skype for business account, i receive it randomly, for no reason, when it's been verified 100 times before.. and i have to enter the code every time.. so annoying
Skype	1	2020-10-28T10:23:20+00:00	Awful interface.Settings either in wrong places or completely hidden. Grid views never work properly. Caller windows don't appear. People can't see each other. No clear idea why certain video windows don't appear on main screen as grid - or at all - but may still indicate as 'connected' via circular profile icons at top. It's a complete mess.
Skype	1	2020-10-25T15:11:14+00:00	"Signed up as I am sick of being charged ludicrous charges for landline calls. Complete waste of time as recipients don't receive calls from Skype....looked online and suggested adding a caller ID, finally found that and it wouldn't accept either my landline or mobile number as ID....should have guessed M$ would have put the kiss of death on Skype, just look at Windows 10 - a total joke

UPDATE
As I couldn't get it to accept my mobile number and could find no way to contact them, other than automated M$ BS I opened a Paypal dispute and they instantly refunded my money....good riddance, wish I could be refunded for totally useless, waste of everybody's time, Windows 10 too but I didn't buy it as I had it forced onto me when they ended support for Windows 7. Which always worked just fine, usual in denial M$ always thinking they are right but just seriously haven't got a clue"
Skype	1	2020-10-17T05:27:35+00:00	Skype live captions are abysmal!  The text is unreal, and absolutely NOT what’s being spoken!  Nonsensical.  Absolute rubbish.  Why have this app if it just does not work!  Best just remove it.  Totally rubbish. Extremely disappointed as I was hoping to be able to use this app.
Skype	1	2020-10-16T05:59:25+00:00	"cant leave 0 stars. Or negative stars. But If I could I would leave negative stars.  Or a very dark, dark black 1 star. Please do not add up the 1 star ratings from all your unsatisfied customers, you cannot count up the 1 stars to make more stars.  Bad Microsoft.

Unresolved issue about billing after 5 contacts with skype customer support over a month with different but equally unhelpful advice provided at each encounter, acknowledged to be a skype side error rather than a banking error because ""there was a limit on the account are being set automatically by the system/you already reached the purchase limit"".  Please note that even attempting the lowest refill of 3.87USD as suggested by the last manager could not be processed. (brackets: ""I'm sorry sir, your deposit services have been suspended, you have deposited 19USD into our bank over the last month and the system can no longer allow you to deposit 3.87USD: compu'a says no, please try again in a month"".).   Customer support, my suggestion would be change profession to another company: have you tried Viber?

I understand this is a chat forum for microsoft Skype, so I should ask a question to open dialogue: can anyone suggest a better system of VOIP or has anyone tried Viber? 

So just to confirm: my account was created over a month ago (around 9 august), had ~20USD added to the accoun which was used over the last month, and you cannot add USD3.87 credit to the account because ""because the system is not allowing you to purchase since you already reached the purchase limit"". Please confirm this as yes or no.

Skype	1	2020-10-28T10:23:20+00:00	Awful interface.Settings either in wrong places or completely hidden. Grid views never work properly. Caller windows don't appear. People can't see each other. No clear idea why certain video windows don't appear on main screen as grid - or at all - but may still indicate as 'connected' via circular profile icons at top. It's a complete mess.
Skype	1	2020-10-25T15:11:14+00:00	"Signed up as I am sick of being charged ludicrous charges for landline calls. Complete waste of time as recipients don't receive calls from Skype....looked online and suggested adding a caller ID, finally found that and it wouldn't accept either my landline or mobile number as ID....should have guessed M$ would have put the kiss of death on Skype, just look at Windows 10 - a total joke

UPDATE
As I couldn't get it to accept my mobile number and could find no way to contact them, other than automated M$ BS I opened a Paypal dispute and they instantly refunded my money....good riddance, wish I could be refunded for totally useless, waste of everybody's time, Windows 10 too but I didn't buy it as I had it forced onto me when they ended support for Windows 7. Which always worked just fine, usual in denial M$ always thinking they are right but just seriously haven't got a clue"
Skype	1	2020-10-17T05:27:35+00:00	Skype live captions are abysmal!  The text is unreal, and absolutely NOT what’s being spoken!  Nonsensical.  Absolute rubbish.  Why have this app if it just does not work!  Best just remove it.  Totally rubbish. Extremely disappointed as I was hoping to be able to use this app.
Skype	1	2020-10-16T05:59:25+00:00	"cant leave 0 stars. Or negative stars. But If I could I would leave negative stars.  Or a very dark, dark black 1 star. Please do not add up the 1 star ratings from all your unsatisfied customers, you cannot count up the 1 stars to make more stars.  Bad Microsoft.

Unresolved issue about billing after 5 contacts with skype customer support over a month with different but equally unhelpful advice provided at each encounter, acknowledged to be a skype side error rather than a banking error because ""there was a limit on the account are being set automatically by the system/you already reached the purchase limit"".  Please note that even attempting the lowest refill of 3.87USD as suggested by the last manager could not be processed. (brackets: ""I'm sorry sir, your deposit services have been suspended, you have deposited 19USD into our bank over the last month and the system can no longer allow you to deposit 3.87USD: compu'a says no, please try again in a month"".).   Customer support, my suggestion would be change profession to another company: have you tried Viber?

I understand this is a chat forum for microsoft Skype, so I should ask a question to open dialogue: can anyone suggest a better system of VOIP or has anyone tried Viber? 

So just to confirm: my account was created over a month ago (around 9 august), had ~20USD added to the accoun which was used over the last month, and you cannot add USD3.87 credit to the account because ""because the system is not allowing you to purchase since you already reached the purchase limit"". Please confirm this as yes or no.

Skype	3	2021-01-12T17:06:39+00:00	It shows my credit in Danish Corona but I live in Finland. I don´t see how to change currency.
Skype	1	2021-01-10T16:58:00+00:00	Disgusting. Skype effectively operated as a scam. Took my money, then won't reconise my microphone. The microphone is in perfect working order. It has worked without problems with endless apps and websites, and I've checked and it still works fine with other apps!
Skype	3	2020-12-28T11:57:59+00:00	"Outdated.

 Simply an outdated platform, it is still a decent one but it is simply old. Most people migrated to other platforms, it is not like skype is bad just... who you gonna talk to there is no one uses it any longer?"
Skype	1	2020-12-27T14:29:41+00:00	"When Skype came out I thought it was a great app but since Microsoft got its claws into it, it got worse and worse.
The interface is terrible. For instance, when you are in call mode or on the contact screen there is no option to return to the main screen where the profile is.
You can't edit a phone number that has been copied and pasted because when you press on the number, it is completely erased and many more inconsistencies that I'm too pissed off to continue writing"
Skype	5	2020-12-20T21:05:07+00:00	My favorite app for business calls.
Skype	4	2020-12-18T21:49:13+00:00	"I use Skype everyday for work, and I must admit I have found it the best out of all the video-conference platforms. 
It's easy to connect and find contacts, you can see who is online, you have a record of how long your calls last, you can voice or video call, you cant send images and chat while on the call.
The only issue I have come across is while screen sharing, Skype starts to massively lag and often cannot keep up. It cannot take the weight of this feature, unlike Zoom for example which is much faster in that regard. However I find it the easiest to use out of all and the most transparent."
Skype	1	2020-12-07T02:54:32+00:00	Very bad customer service. I have no idea how a big company like this can have a hard time replying to its customers???!!! I don't appreciate big companies that are not willing to invest more into customer service.
Skype	1	2020-12-06T16:25:38+00:00	I hate using Skype--much prefer Zoom--but I have to in order to communicate with a certain group of folks.  The reason I hate Skype is that it's technical support for me is totally meaningless.  No, that's not right, it's worse than meaningless, it's misleading.
Skype	5	2020-12-06T13:25:43+00:00	I like the new update of Skype! I am using Skype for my online teaching, and it is very convenient and easy to navigate. So far this is the best platform in terms of the sound quality especially in piano teaching. I am using Skype years ago and the quality is still up to par.
Skype	4	2020-12-01T21:40:13+00:00	Used it only for a few months but did not have any issue. Also their customer service was very quick to resolve my refund request.
Skype	1	2020-12-01T08:01:51+00:00	Customer support is always unavailable. In the meantime I receive automated emails stating that they are going to charge me a monthly fee for something I don't even have a subscription to.
Skype	5	2020-11-30T15:59:09+00:00	Excellent App, it just needs to be faster
Skype	1	2020-11-29T11:48:59+00:00	"The design of Skype is very bad. 
There are boxes, all over the screen, you close one and another opens, sometimes there are two boxes.
There is an emoji that flashes, not sure why, as there are only 8 available, this is very annoying, we use this for business, we don't need a heart emoji flashing during a sales call.
How can Microsoft, not design Skype to be simple and efficient, like Zoom?
Why does it need to be so badly designed?"
Skype	1	2020-11-27T16:13:40+00:00	Purchased a subscription from Skype but the number didn't work.  Tried to get through to CS, but it was impossible.  In the end, I cancelled my subscription.  Stick with the free service.
